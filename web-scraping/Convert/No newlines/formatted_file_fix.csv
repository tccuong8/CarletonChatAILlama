Windows Admin Accounts: Setting/Changing your local account on your Carleton Windows computer,https://stolafcarleton.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2092/Carleton/KB/ArticleDet?ID=136957,"For security reasons, your regular Carleton account is not an administrator account on Windows computers. For things that require administrator rights, there is a separate .\admin account that you can use.  The password for this account should be something that only you know, and it should be different from your regular Carleton password. Contact the ITS Helpdesk to ask for the temporary .\admin account password that was assigned to your machine (call x5999 or open a ticket ) Open the Start menu and search for lusrmgr.msc Right click on lusrmgr.msc, and then click Run as administrator . Log in using .\admin as the username (note the \ , not / ), and the temporary password the Helpdesk gave you Double click on Users Right click on the admin user (not “Administrator” or “Carladmin”), and select Set Password… Click Proceed Enter a new password, and click OK Click OK to confirm the change, and close the user manager window Notes about setting this password: The password for the .\admin account is completely disconnected from any of your other accounts, including your regular Carleton one.  We recommend setting a unique passphrase not only so that there is greater account security but also because if you use your Carleton password, this .\admin password will not update if you update your Carleton password. For this reason we recommend keeping a record of this password, and we highly recommend using a secure password manager to do so . Since this password guards your computer system from unauthorized changes, do not enter it if you get an unexpected request for it or if the request comes from a program you do not recognize. When in doubt, call the ITS Helpdesk: 507-222-5999 ."

Scanning on Canon Multifunction Devices (MFDs),https://stolafcarleton.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2092/Carleton/KB/ArticleDet?ID=145032,"In this article Scanning using the Canon Multi-Function Printers Ways to Scan/Receive the Scanned Document Scanning Settings Additional Information Scanning using the Multi-Function Printers Login by typing in your username and password or by scanning your oneCard on the panel. Choose Scan Choose My Personal Account or enter an Account Code if you have one Choose your preferred way of receiving the scanned document Choose your own options or leave them as default and then press Start At the end of the complete scan, you must choose the green Finish button within 1 hour, or the scan file will never be saved or sent. To logout of the MFD, choose the exit (door) icon after your name at the upper right of the screen or scan your OneCard again on the panel Ways to Scan/Receive the Scanned Document Scan to My Email: scans the document and sends it to your Carleton email. Scan for (cloud) OCR: adds searchable text to the ""pictures"" of your document pages, using a process called Optical Character Recognition. The PDF or Word file is uploaded to the PaperCut cloud service, text is interpreted in up to 10 languages (the same languages used with Microsoft Office, except Greek), and the resulting PDF or Word file with its searchable text is emailed to your Carleton email . Check the settings carefully before starting the scan. If the Orientation , Paper size , or Duplex mode setting does not match the actual paper document, the OCR interpretation will not work as expected. The interpretation may take some time, so please wait for the email. PaperCut does not retain any trace of your scan file after sending it to your Carleton email account. Scan to My Google Drive: does not send an email. Instead, it saves the scan file on your Carleton Google Drive , in a top-level folder labeled Scans for PaperCut MF . In this action, you might change the Filename field before starting the scan, to more easily find the scan file later. Scan to My Dropbox , works like the scanning to Google Drive, but saves the scan file in your Carleton Dropbox account , if you have one . It creates a top-level folder called Apps , then saves the scan file in a folder labeled Scans for PaperCut MF inside that Apps folder. In this action, you might change the Filename field before starting the scan, to more easily find the scan file later. PaperCut Scan settings Each PaperCut Scan Action starts with some assumptions about your paper document, displayed on the right side of the screen. If any of these settings does not match your actual paper document, the scan file may not capture what you want. Therefore, please review each setting before you start a scan, and use the ""Change settings"" button to adjust any setting. Duplex mode (default 1-sided): If your paper document is printed on both sides, you must change this to 2-sided. Orientation (default portrait): If your paper document is wider than it is tall when held in viewing position, change this to landscape. An OCR scan will fail if this is not correct. Paper size (default Letter): Match the size of your paper document. Letter is 8.5 x 11""; Legal is 8.5 x 14""; Ledger, also called Tabloid, is 11 x 17"". If your document is not any of these common paper sizes, choose the next larger size. If you do not choose a large enough paper size setting, the scan will appear ""chopped off""; it does not shrink the scan image to fit. File type (default PDF): If you know you need a different file type than Adobe PDF, choose it here. You might prefer to save graphic images or photographs in the JPEG format. Some document processing or storage systems may prefer files in the TIFF format. DPI (default 300): This is the resolution of the scan in dots per inch. The default of 300 dpi matches the lowest resolution of most printers today. Most fax machines send faxes with a maximum resolution of 200 dpi. Small images displayed on a Web page may use 100 (or 96) dpi. To create a smaller scan file, choose a lower resolution. For a sharper image, choose a higher resolution. Color mode (default color): Whether the scan file preserves any color from the original paper document. For a smaller scan file, choose Grayscale; Black & White is even smaller still. Prompt for more pages (default yes): Whether to continue prompting you for more pages when the current pages are done, or automatically stop the scan when the paper document has fed through. By default, it keeps prompting for more until you choose the green Finish button. If you forget to press Finish, the scan file will be discarded after 1 hour without being sent or saved. Other settings The Filename and Subject lines can be changed by pressing the text and typing in a new one using the touch-pad keyboard. The default scan settings shown on the right can be changed by choosing the gray Change settings button. Additional information Other types of OneCards – affiliate, department copy (deptcopy-), guest – cannot use the new PaperCut Scan Actions, but must use the old Canon MFD Scan and Send button. Friends of the College oneCards may not be able to login at all, so they can use the anonymous scan 1/0 manual login. At the end of the complete scan, you must choose the green Finish button within 1 hour, or the scan file will never be saved or sent. Every successful or failed scan will be followed up with an email from printmaster@carleton.edu telling you the status of the scan. Any action that sends the scan file by email (envelope icon) is limited to the size of a Gmail attachment, which is 20MB . Therefore, such actions will split the scan at every 20 pages. In any scan action that sends the scan file to a cloud storage service (cloud icon), the scan file size is limited to 200MB . Therefore, such actions will split the scan file every 200 pages. The first time you scan to either cloud service, like Google Drive or Dropbox, you will receive an email asking whether PaperCut can use your account in that service. Until you click the link in that email, your scan file will not be delivered to your cloud account. Once PaperCut has permission for a cloud service, it will not ask again. If your paper document is too big to be sent or saved, use Change settings to scan it again at a lower resolution or in a less colorful mode. Or just split the paper document into smaller parts and scan each part, like a chapter, separately."

Equipment purchased through this portal is offered featuring Carleton's purchasing discount through CDW-G. Use this special link to create your account using your Carleton email address: cdwg.com/epp/2241236 Then view Carleton's purchasing portal to view Carleton's ""bundles"" (listed in the navigation bar) and other discounted items. Select the computer you would like to purchase Select a warranty (these are HIGHLY recommended as any liquid spill or dropped computer repair will far exceed the cost of the warranty) Our Bundles include a warranty, though if you buy a Windows computer we highly recommend that you add an Accidental Damage warranty to your order. If you do not select a Bundle, you will have to select your own warranty Check out Note that warranties are very important for college-bound laptops. Since modern laptops offer fewer component-level repair options, the cost of fixing the damage arising from a single drop or spill can easily justify the cost of the warranty."

Purchasing a Personal Computer: Advice and Resources,https://stolafcarleton.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2092/Carleton/KB/ArticleDet?ID=137623,"We're often asked, ""What's the best kind of computer to bring to Carleton?"" The honest answer is that there isn't really a ""best kind;"" it's more of a ""best fit"". The best computer for any person is a computer that they are comfortable using, and that can do the work that they need it to do. For example, a person interested in video editing has a different ""best"" computer than someone who plans to spend most of their time reading articles or writing essays. Regardless of the type, we do recommend that all students bring a computer with them to campus. The computer purchasing portal (details below) provides a great start on recommended specifications and models, and also offers a small discount on pricing. If purchasing a computer presents an unmanageable financial burden, the college has several ways to help meet demonstrated need. The Office of the Provost can help you navigate this process. Carleton's Computer Purchasing Portal Carleton students, faculty, and staff can purchase a computer through our partner, CDW. Instructions for creating an account and using our CDW Purchasing Portal Other purchasing options include: Look for ""Refurbished"" or ""Outlet"" options from computer manufacturers. Apple, Dell, and Lenovo all offer excellent refurbished options. Most retailers also offer sales. The sale might not be for the newest model, but can save you a lot of money for a very good machine. Specs and Suggestions Computer specs can sound like a foreign language! Here's a Beginner's Guide to Reading Computer Specifications . Computer: Baseline Model (mid-tier) These computers should be able to last for 4 years, and they have the computing power to accomplish the things most people at Carleton need to do. These specifications match what we supply to campus computer labs and to most faculty and staff. CPU options Intel Quad Core i5 Ryzen 5 Apple M1 RAM (memory) 16GB Storage (harddrive) 256GB SSD (Solid State Drive) if you save most things to the cloud (Google Drive or Dropbox) 512GB SSD (Solid State Drive) if you save large files to your computer's harddrive Warranty We highly recommend accidental damage coverage. One coffee spill will easily justify the cost of a warranty Machines that match these options are listed on our page of Standard Computing Equipment for Carleton Employees Computer: Economy Model (Lower-Tier) Prioritizing price without sacrificing too much in performance, look for computers that have: CPU options Intel Quad Core i5 Apple M1 RAM (memory) 8GB Storage (harddrive) 128GB SSD (Solid State Drive) if you save most things to the cloud (Google Drive or Dropbox) 256GB SSD (Solid State Drive) if you save large files to your computer's harddrive Warranty We highly recommend accidental damage coverage. One coffee spill will easily justify the cost of a warranty Machines that match these options include: Microsoft Surface Laptop Apple MacBook Air Monitors, keyboards, etc If you're hoping to purchase external monitors and other computer-related equipment for a home office, please see our list of Standard Computing Equipment for Carleton Employees for specs and suggestions Additional Considerations Chromebooks We have found that Chromebooks don't provide enough functionality or options to meet all the needs of a four year career at Carleton. While they can easily be used to check Moodle, email, chat sessions, etc. the are not always suited for curricular work. Chromebooks are incompatible with a lot of software packages commonly used on campus, such as Office, the stats suite R, or Mathematica. Chromebooks can connect to the wireless and wired networks, as well as print to Carleton printers. However, depending on the classes that you take in any given term, you should expect to make liberal use of the public campus labs work. For more information, please consult the What is a Chromebook section from this fantastic article by Wirecutter : The Best Chromebook . Tablets Tablets are the pinnacle of portability. Unfortunately, those running iOS or Android operating system cannot install much of the software used in the Carleton curriculum (Microsoft Office Suite, Rstudio, etc.). Windows tablets circumvent these issues, but often at the cost of performance and disk space on low-cost models, or price on the higher-performance models. Wirecutter has a great breakdown of tablets in their article Can an iPad Pro or Surface Pro Tablet Replace Your Laptop? Operating Systems (Mac vs Windows) While people often have strong opinions about Mac vs Windows, it really just comes down to personal preference. Both operating systems are very good and both will serve you well at Carleton.  If you end up needing to use a program that only works on one operating system (and not the one you have) there's a good chance that you'll be able to use a Computer Lab or RemoteLab machine to accomplish your goals. Laptop Screen Sizes The size of the screen is really what governs the overall size (and most of the weight) of a laptop. The importance of screen size is related perhaps most importantly to your vision. There has been a definite trend towards smaller screen sizes in laptops in recent years. Smaller screens with higher resolutions often means smaller text on the screen, which can be a problem if poor eyesight is a consideration (While you can change the resolution settings on laptops, the picture is far superior when running in the native resolution i.e. the default). Another consideration is the type of work you will be doing on the laptop and the amount of “real estate” you want on your screen. For example, if you prefer to work with multiple windows open and visible, a larger screen will be more important. Or you may want to purchase an external monitor to use when you're at your desk. Recommended monitor specs are listed here . Graphics Cards The primary disadvantage of an integrated graphics card is that it does not have its own resources (processor and memory) for performing graphics tasks. Instead, it taps into the main system resources, which reduces the amount available to other processes or programs. The more intense the graphics, the slower other processes or programs will perform. A discrete graphics card or chip, on the other hand, has its own processor and memory and handles all of the graphics work itself. This means that graphics processes are far less likely to adversely affect the performance of the machine. In fact, overall performance should be better. Current integrated graphics are vastly superior to those of the past and may be adequate for many people. However, the graphics (or visual) demands placed on personal computers is only going to increase, so more machines are offering the option of an upgrade to a discrete chip. Disclaimer Please note that we have no arrangements, deals, or kick-backs with any of the manufacturers included in our matching machines above. Once we had decided on our specifications for each category, we simply checked the manufacturer's websites and selected those models that matched our numbers. In the interests of disclosure, the bulk of Carleton's computers are purchased from Apple, Dell, Lenovo, and Microsoft, through our vendor CDW-G. Apple offers no special discount for members of the Carleton community, but rather offers a standard Educational Discount to any customers who qualify. Both Dell and Lenovo have, in the past, worked with Carleton to offer computer packages matching our baseline specification at a reduced price, but no such arrangement exists at the time of publishing these recommendations. The Computer Purchasing Portal offered through CDW-G does, however, offer the same discount that Carleton receives on our equipment orders."

If you would like to verify the validity of a message you receive, you can reach out to the sender or business directly through a known good contact method. To report a suspicious email: Follow google's instructions for reporting phishing . To learn more about types of malicious emails: Read Carleton's wiki page describing common malicious email tactics , with examples."
Top Security Practices for Students,https://stolafcarleton.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2092/Carleton/KB/ArticleDet?ID=137387,"Antivirus. Antivirus has been around for a long time and although no antivirus provides absolute protection against all malware, running any reputable antivirus program is better than nothing. Carleton uses and can recommend Malwarebytes . It can be run full-featured for 30 days for free. To use it beyond 30 days requires a low-cost subscription at your expense. Microsoft Security (formerly known as Microsoft Defender) is available for free with all current versions of Microsoft Windows AVG or AVAST are both good options Legacy vendors like Norton, McAfee, Symantec, and Trend are also good options Keep Your Browser Locked Down . So much of our time online is spent in a web browser, and because the browser stands between you and the sites and services you consume, you should keep your browser as secure as possible. Keep your browser up to date . Turn on automatic updates whenever possible. Do not install untrustworthy plug-ins and uninstall browser plug-ins that you no longer use or need. Do install a security plug-in that will protect you from online threats. Malwarebytes offers a free plugin for Chrome, Edge, and Firefox browsers that protects against threats specifically coming your way via the browser. Keep Your Software Up to Date. Software updates don't only provide new features, they often also supply performance improvements, and importantly, security fixes. Update the operating system for your computers and phones as often as updates are released. This is true also for the applications that run on your devices and also your other electronic devices like game consoles, wireless routers, smart speakers, WiFi light bulbs, etc. Turn on automatic updates whenever possible. Identify and report phishing. If you suspect an email message is phishing--attempting to steal your username and password or attempting to defraud you in some way, report it. The best and easiest way to phishing is to use the “Report phishing” menu item in Gmail. This will immediately notify the information security officer and email administrators. It will include all the information they need to investigate and take any appropriate actions--actions like deleting the messages, blocking the sender, and notifying any other recipients who may have been duped by the phishing message. Don't torrent, just don't. There are legitimate uses for BitTorrent, like downloading open-source software. If this is how you use BitTorrent, fine. However, most use BitTorrent to illegally share or download copyrighted materials like music, movies, television shows, and software. Illegally sharing or downloading copyrighted material is a violation of the college's acceptable use of technology policy. Violations can result in disciplinary action and loss of network access privileges. It is especially important not to torrent software. Installing software from a disreputable source is exceptionally unwise. Torrented software is a well-known vector for Trojans, viruses, and malware. Use eduroam. For a variety of reasons, Eduroam is the most secure option for users with a Carleton login. Use MFA everywhere. Carleton requires multi-factor authentication for accessing most sites and services. It is a good idea to turn on multi-factor authentication for your personal accounts whenever possible, particularly your financial and shopping accounts, but also your email accounts, and your social accounts. MFA will keep your personal data safe and protect your bank accounts even if your password is compromised. Exercise good password management. Don’t share passwords between apps. Use a unique password for each application, website, or service. If you share passwords between sites and services, your password, and therefore your data, is only as safe as the weakest site. Use long, strong passwords or passphrases. Long passwords are mathematically more secure than short complex passwords. Use a password manager. Security professionals agree that the benefits of using a password manager outweigh the risks. Carleton uses and can strongly recommend LastPass. However, there are other reputable vendors in this space including Dashlane, 1Password, and Keypass. Back up files and data regularly. Set up automatic backups of your device and store the backup to a cloud service or external hard drive. A reliable backup is your best defense against ransomware. Use Care with Social Networks. Social networks can be a useful and fun way to connect with and stay in touch with friends and family. However, they also present risks to your privacy. Ensure that your privacy settings are set in the way that you desire. Consider viewing your online profiles, unauthenticated from a browser window in incognito mode to make sure that only the information you want is available to the general public. Avoid games, quizzes, and surveys that are often designed merely to mine you for personal data or harvest information from your profile. Similarly, only connect with people you want to have access to the information you share privately. For more tips, check out the StaySafeOnline Social Networks page and the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse fact sheet on Social Networking Privacy ."

WiFi: Connecting Smart Devices,https://stolafcarleton.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2092/Carleton/KB/ArticleDet?ID=136854,"Smart Devices on Carleton’s Network These devices may not function well within large enterprise networks such as Carleton's, and therefore Carleton does not officially support these devices. While not officially supported, these devices can sometimes be made to work by following a similar process to registering game consoles and other devices like them. Instructions First you need to obtain the MAC address of the device. The process for finding this is device dependent, but the manufacturer will generally have a support page detailing this process. If the device supports Ethernet and WiFi it will have separate MAC addresses for both, and you only need to find the relevant one for however you want to set up the device (i.e. the WiFi MAC address if you will be using it on WiFi and the Ethernet address if using it with an Ethernet cable). Then you will need to connect it to Carleton Guests. Follow these instructions for a wired (ethernet) smart device: Connecting to Ethernet Follow these instructions for a wireless (WiFi) smart device: Connecting Gaming Consoles and devices without browsers If you are connecting your device to WiFi, it must be connected to CarletonGuests. These devices cannot be used on the eduroam network, as they don't have the security encryption capabilities required by the network. You must then connect your cell phone or whichever device you are using to control the home device with CarletonGuests as well. If you are still unable to control and access the smart home device after this setup process, unfortunately there is nothing further that can be done to support the device. Troubleshooting Connectivity Between Devices If two connected devices (phone and Chromecast, for instance) are registered on clearpass1.carleton.edu/guest and both are connected to CarletonGuest and you still don’t see the device, make sure that your phone/tablet/laptop does NOT randomize or make private its MAC address for the CarletonGuest network (Google disable private address [device name] or disable randomized mac address [device name] for device-specific instructions)."

Student Printing: Managing your Print Quota,https://stolafcarleton.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2092/Carleton/KB/ArticleDet?ID=137288,"The Print Quota Each student at the beginning of the year starts with $96 for their printing quota. This gets used up as they print at Carleton printers. How much does it cost to print? Normal printing for everyone (including non-Carleton people): Black & White: $0.04 per side Color: $0.15 per side Duplexed printing to a Public Lab Computer ONLY: Black & White: $0.07 per duplexed sheet (front and back sides - single charge) Color: $0.29 per duplexed sheet (front and back sides - single charge) How do I see my balance? Visit go.carleton.edu/webprint Click the ""Add Credit"" link on the left side to see your current balance. ""Current Balance"" refers to your Printing Account, or quota; ""Schillers"" refers to how many Schillers you have on your OneCard. What happens if I don’t use all my printing money? There is a common misconception about print quotas, specifically that a student's print quota references a financial award or dollar amount given to that student for the sole purpose of printing. Instead, t he print quota simply sets an upper limit on free printing. If a student exceeds that quota, they are expected to pay for the extra pages themselves. If a student doesn't use the whole allotment of free printing, there is no refund because no money was awarded. On average, most students do not use up their allotment of free printing. How do I transfer money to my printing account? Visit go.carleton.edu/webprint Log in using your Carleton username and password (or the username and password printed on your OneCard, if you are a Friend of the College). Select the ""Add Credit"" link on the left side. Select how much money you would like to transfer to your printing account.

Duo: Streamlining Authentication,https://stolafcarleton.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2092/Carleton/KB/ArticleDet?ID=137068,"Remember Me For 60 Days You can select this small gray box on the Duo authentication screen so that the device you are currently using will no longer prompt you for a Duo authentication for the next sixty days. Issues with Remember Me for 60 Days Duo requires cookies for this function. Here are instructions for enabling cookies in the most common browsers . On iOS devices, the only browser that can capture the correct kind of cookie for this function is Safari . Any other browser on an iOS device will not be able to remember you for 60 days. If you clear your browser's cookies and cache during this period, this will reset the token that Duo uses to track your device and thus the browser will no longer automatically remember your second authentication.  Simply check the box again and you should be good for the next 60 days or until you next clear cookies and cache. Automatic Push Notifications You can set Duo to automatically send you a Push Notification when you are prompted for a second factor authentication, rather than having to select the push notification option each time. On the Duo page that prompts you to select an authentication option, go to Settings in the upper right corner Select My Settings and Devices and authenticate yourself Change the option under When I log in to Automatically send this device a Duo push However, when automatic push notifications are set, it can be more complicated to set the ""Remember me"" option. If automatic push notifications are on and you would like to set your device to remember you for the next 60 days, you can do the following: Do not approve the first push notification you receive from Duo At the Duo authentication page, press the blue cancel button at the bottom of the page next to the Pushed a login request to your device... message Check the Remember me for 60 days box Select Send me a push and approve the new request Now your device should remember you while also sending automatic push notifications Need Help?

Archiving or Transferring Email,https://stolafcarleton.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2092/Carleton/KB/ArticleDet?ID=143859,"Class of '23 Deadline :  End of July After July, messages in your Carleton mailbox vanish and are non-recoverable; mail sent to your address will be returned to the sender. While it is tempting to simply move all of your email from your Carleton Gmail account to, for example, your personal Gmail account, we suggest that you consider archiving your Carleton email instead. One of the main reasons for this is that there is no elegant method for transferring email between two different systems. The methods below will work, though they will not transfer the labels that you have created in your Carleton account. Archiving email has the advantage that you are simply downloading and storing the email for future reference, in case you need to refer back to it in the future. It helps to keep your old Carleton email separate from your current (or new) email, in a searchable location for those times that you need to refer back to it.

Email: Transferring Carleton email to a personal Gmail account,https://stolafcarleton.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2092/Carleton/KB/ArticleDet?ID=143858,"Moving email between accounts is never a straightforward process, not even when moving between Google accounts. NOTE: This process can take days or even weeks depending on the size of your email account. Prepare your Personal Account Check how much storage space your Carleton email account takes. If you scroll down to the very bottom of your inbox it'll say "" Using "" and then a number of MG (Megabytes) or GB (Gigabytes) Check your storage limit on your Personal account and make sure that there is enough space left to accommodate the amount of email stored in your Carleton account.

However, if you run into issues with that tool, here's how to manage your transfer manually. Create an App Specific Password for your Carleton gmail account Manually transfer your mail using POP3 Carleton Username: your full Carleton email address Carleton Password: use the App-specific password you created in Step 1 POP Server: pop.gmail.com Port: 995 Deselect ""leave a copy of retrieved message on the server"" Select ""always use a secure connection (SSL) when retrieving mail"" Select ""Label incoming messages"" with the default label Deselect ""archive incoming messages (Skip the inbox)"" Transfer will begin within 5-10 minutes Note that this method is limited by Google's bandwidth policies and will transfer approximately 38,000 messages per day."
Email: Transferring very large email accounts,https://stolafcarleton.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2092/Carleton/KB/ArticleDet?ID=144518,"Google offers a Transfer tool that works well for most people and most email accounts. However, sometimes that tool fails, and it seems that it may fail if confronted with very large email accounts (e.g. 100GB of storage). In cases like this, you will have to rely on the options below. Transfer messages and attachments while preserving folders/labels This will be an almost entirely manual process and will have to happen slowly so as not to exceed Google's bandwidth limits (which will lock the Google account). 1) Prepare your Accounts Check how much storage space your Carleton email account takes. If you scroll down to the very bottom of your inbox it'll say "" Using "" and then a number of MG (Megabytes) or GB (Gigabytes) Check your storage limit on your Personal account and make sure that there is enough space left to accommodate the amount of email stored in your Carleton account. Purchase additional storage if necessary Turn IMAP on for BOTH of your gmail accounts Install the Thunderbird email application 2) Connect Thunderbird to both of your gmail accounts IMPORTANT : Pay attention to the options when you connect each account so that you only download the most recent messages from your very large account. Otherwise you may end up using up all the storage space on your computer, which can result in an unusable computer. In the Thunderbird application, go to the File menu and select New > Existing Mail Account Enter your name, full email address, and password, and click Continue Keep the default IMAP option (don't switch to POP3) and click Done A new window will pop up so that you can fully log into your account and allow access for Thunderbird When you get to the screen in Thunderbird that says that your account has been successfully created, click on Account Settings Click on Synchronization & Storage Under Disk Space , select the option to synchronize the most recent 30 days (you can probably increase this to 90 days, but this setting will save your computer from being overwhelmed by email messages) Repeat these steps for your other gmail account NOTE : If you have a downloaded .MBOX file of your Carleton email, you can connect that to Thunderbird instead of connecting to your live email account (instructions coming soon). Messages can be moved over to your new account in exactly the same way regardless of how you access your Carleton email. 3) Transfer messages folder by folder This is the very manual part. You will have to repeat this process for each folder/label from your Carleton account. In Thunderbird, right click on the gmail address of your destination account and select New Folder Create a new folder with the same name as one of the folders in your Carleton email account In your Carleton account within Thunderbird, select the messages from the folder in your Carleton account that you've just recreated in your new account (select up to about 5,000 messages at a time unless you have a lot of attachments, in which case select fewer) Drag the email messages into the new folder in your destination gmail account within Thunderbird Repeat the process of selecting messages from your Carleton account and dragging them to the recreated folder in your destination account until you have emptied the Carleton folder into the destination folder Repeat these steps for every folder you want to preserve/recreate in your destination account NOTE : You can only move 500MB of messages per day, and if you go over that limit Google will lock your accounts for 24 hours. There is very little way to know exactly how many MB you have moved, so a good rule of thumb for a normal inbox is to move about 20,000 messages in a day but no more. 4) Transfer remaining messages after folders are moved Once all the messages in folders have been transferred, you can move on to a more automated method that can also move more messages per day. Use the ""Manual"" method listed here to set up a POP3 transfer from your Carleton account to a destination account . This will move approximately 1250MB per day, or about 38,000 messages per day depending on the number and size of the attachments on your messages. Transfer messages and attachments only (no labels) Use the ""Manual"" method listed here to set up a POP3 transfer from your Carleton account to a destination account . This will move approximately 1250MB per day, or about 38,000 messages per day depending on the number and size of the attachments on your messages."

For some groups, there will be two linked groups to manage membership: a group created based on some data-driven criteria (i.e. ""first year students"" or ""Declared History majors"") plus a group with the name [Group Name]-extras@carleton.edu. Ultimate group membership is then made up of a combination of the data-driven component and the -extras group membership, which then allows group owners to add members to the data-driven list as needed."

Google Drive: Managing File Ownership,https://stolafcarleton.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2092/Carleton/KB/ArticleDet?ID=146559&SIDs=11637,"In Google Drive, only one account owns any given file or folder, and this owning account is the only one that can reassign ownership or delete files.

For example, if you will be leaving a project or team, you should reassign ownership of all files and folders associated with that project or team to someone who will continue the work. How to transfer ownership of specific files and folders ITS cannot reassign ownership of specific files after a person leaves the college.

Google Drive: Three Main Sections of Google Drive,https://stolafcarleton.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2092/Carleton/KB/ArticleDet?ID=146459&SIDs=11637,"Google Drive is organized into three main sections. You can search across all three sections using the search box at the top of the screen, but your default permissions and available actions changes in each section.  This video, and the text below, walks you through the different parts of Google Drive. My Drive This is where documents you create start by default unless you create them while you're in a shared drive. Within My Drive you can create folders and organize your files , share files and folders , and for files that live primarily in Shared Drives or in Shared With Me, you can create shortcuts in My Drive so that you can find those files easily. Files owned by you apply to your total storage. Within My Drive, the person who creates a document is by default the document Owner and is the only person who can delete a file or transfer ownership of that file. Be aware that you can only transfer ownership to accounts ending with @carleton.edu. If you need to transfer ownership to an account outside of Carleton, you will have to download the file and have that other account upload the file to that account's My Drive. When you leave the college, files that you've shared with others may become unavailable to them unless you transfer ownership of the file to them, or they have made a copy. Similarly, when those who have shared files with you leave the college, you may lose access to the files. Shared Drives Shared Drives are owned by a team rather than by an individual, and are therefore more stable when team membership changes. Files and folders don't become ""orphaned"" when their creator leaves the College, so other team members can manage sharing and delete files when needed. Google provides information on Shared Drives and how they compare with My Drive . Files stored here don't count against an individual's storage. Anyone with a Carleton Google Account can set up and manage Shared Drives . Shared Drive members can the put files and folders into the Shared Drive so that the content will remain available to future group members even if current group members leave the college. Quick Tip: You can add a Google Group as a member of a Shared Drive so that membership is managed by the membership of the Google Group. Shared with Me Files and folders that someone else created and shared with you are listed in the Shared With Me section of Google Drive. These may have been created in the other person's My Drive section, or they may have been shared with you from within another team's Shared Drive. You can manage items in Shared With Me by integrating them into your Drive via shortcut or by removing yourself from the shared item. Since you are not the owner of any files in this section, you cannot delete items or change item ownership. These files do not apply to your total storage. When the owner leaves the college, these files will become unavailable to you unless the owner transfers ownership prior to leaving, or if you have made a copy."

If the call is international: Dial 011 followed by the country code . If the call is long distance within North America: Dial 1 (the country code for the US and Canada). If you are not sure if the call is long-distance, try with a 1 first, if it does not complete try again and leave out the 1 Some 507 numbers require this long-distance 1. Dial the 3-digit area code Dial the 7-digit number Questions Why do we dial 8 now instead of 9? Federal law now requires that 911 can be dialed without the initial 9 (so 911, rather than 9911); we are changing off-campus calls to use 8 to reduce the chance of accidentally dialing 911 when calling an international or off-campus number."

Best Practices for Inclusive Meetings in Zoom or Google Meet,https://stolafcarleton.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2092/Carleton/KB/ArticleDet?ID=137443&SIDs=10328,"Host Guidance Add That Link! Remember to add a video conferencing link to your meeting invitation when setting up hybrid or remote meetings Space to speak: Create deliberate pauses and time to ask questions for members in person and remote. It may be difficult for a remote member to chime in quickly, so create a space where it is clear that questions/comments are welcome. Take Turns: When asking a question of the group, sometimes you can ask everyone in the meeting to provide a response by going around to call on each individual. To make this more engaging, you can ask a person to “pass” to someone else when they’re done. You’re on camera: When conducting a hybrid meeting, have both the in-person and remote attendees on screen if possible. If your conference room is not equipped with a camera, consult with ITS about room or technology options, or else ask in-person attendees to bring their laptops and also join zoom video. Be sure people in the physical room only join video, not audio, or else multiple audio sources will cause feedback. Respect people’s decisions not to be on camera when remote. There are many possible technical and environmental reasons for these decisions. Running Late? Communicate! If you are going to be late starting the meeting, send a message to attendees to standby. Remote attendees have no way of knowing what is happening in the room and may think the meeting has been cancelled. Be Proactive: Whenever possible, share a meeting agenda ahead of time. If there are materials you need people to review, send them with ample time to review. Attach them to the meeting invitation whenever possible. This will allow your attendees to be well prepared and be able to participate more fully. BYOD (Bring Your Own Device): Hosts should bring their own laptop to conference rooms. Even if the room has a computer in it, you are most familiar with your own set-up and will be able to facilitate meetings more smoothly. Pre-flight check: Test your technology ahead of time so your meeting runs smoothly. You never know when something might need to be updated or, if you just attended a virtual meeting on a different meeting platform, your mic and speaker may need to be readjusted. Tools of engagement: Make virtual meetings more engaging and inclusive by using interactive tools such as polling, chat, or Jamboards to encourage participation for remote and in-person members.  Consult with ITS about how technology can help make your meetings more inclusive. Attendee Guidance RSVP with note: When responding to a meeting invitation, please indicate whether you will be attending virtually or in person . Consider your background: Visual Backgrounds: If you have a lot of visual distraction or a private space in your camera's view, consider a virtual background but keep in mind that virtual backgrounds can be distracting too if they are busy or the camera has trouble distinguishing where you end and your room begins.  Zoom and Meet have a “blur background” option which simply blurs your real life background. Audio Backgrounds: Choose a place that is separate from where other people will be talking whenever possible. Shared office environments are difficult sound environments both for you and for your office mates. If you're in a place where you can't control your background noise, be sure to stay muted whenever you're not speaking so that Zoom doesn't accidentally choose your background noise over other participants when deciding which sounds to share to everyone in the meeting. Cross-talking: Sometimes there is a slight delay for remote meeting members. Take pauses to prevent cross-talking. Where is my microphone? Stay close enough to your microphone so everyone can hear you clearly. If your conference room doesn’t have a reliable microphone, consult with ITS. Shhhhh! Mute when you’re not speaking or when there is background noise.  This is especially important in larger meetings (10+ participants).  At the same time, for smaller meetings, staying unmuted can help foster an easier flow of conversation. You’re on mute. While it’s courteous to mute when you’re not speaking, be ready to unmute at any time and be sure you’re unmuted before speaking. Camera On? For small meetings with a lot of interactivity, having your camera on creates a more inclusive experience.  For large meetings with a primary purpose of listening, having the camera off is reasonable – consider adding a picture of yourself to your profile. You may also need to turn your camera off if your Internet connection is poor.

If you intend to use a headset but Zoom is still using your computer's built-in speakers, for example, this is how you can change your microphone. Zoom selects one participant at a time when it's sharing audio, so it doesn't work well to have two people try to talk at the same time, or to have background noises from one participant ""interrupt"" another participant. Try to make it so that only one microphone at a time needs to be transmitting sound to the group. Choose a place that is separate from where other people will be talking whenever possible. Shared office environments are difficult sound environments both for you and for your office mates. If you're in a place where you can't control your background noise, be sure to stay muted whenever you're not speaking so that Zoom doesn't accidentally choose your background noise over other participants when deciding which sounds to share to everyone in the meeting. Zoom has advice for managing audio echos in meetings Video tips While joining a meeting with your camera on allows for easier collegial interactions, it's not always the best choice. If you have an unstable or slow internet connection, turning off your video can improve your Zoom connection.

Google Drive: Three Main Sections of Google Drive,https://stolafcarleton.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2092/Carleton/KB/ArticleDet?ID=146459,"Google Drive is organized into three main sections. You can search across all three sections using the search box at the top of the screen, but your default permissions and available actions changes in each section.  This video, and the text below, walks you through the different parts of Google Drive. My Drive This is where documents you create start by default unless you create them while you're in a shared drive. Within My Drive you can create folders and organize your files , share files and folders , and for files that live primarily in Shared Drives or in Shared With Me, you can create shortcuts in My Drive so that you can find those files easily. Files owned by you apply to your total storage. Within My Drive, the person who creates a document is by default the document Owner and is the only person who can delete a file or transfer ownership of that file. Be aware that you can only transfer ownership to accounts ending with @carleton.edu. If you need to transfer ownership to an account outside of Carleton, you will have to download the file and have that other account upload the file to that account's My Drive. When you leave the college, files that you've shared with others may become unavailable to them unless you transfer ownership of the file to them, or they have made a copy. Similarly, when those who have shared files with you leave the college, you may lose access to the files. Shared Drives Shared Drives are owned by a team rather than by an individual, and are therefore more stable when team membership changes. Files and folders don't become ""orphaned"" when their creator leaves the College, so other team members can manage sharing and delete files when needed. Google provides information on Shared Drives and how they compare with My Drive . Files stored here don't count against an individual's storage. Anyone with a Carleton Google Account can set up and manage Shared Drives . Shared Drive members can the put files and folders into the Shared Drive so that the content will remain available to future group members even if current group members leave the college. Quick Tip: You can add a Google Group as a member of a Shared Drive so that membership is managed by the membership of the Google Group. Shared with Me Files and folders that someone else created and shared with you are listed in the Shared With Me section of Google Drive. These may have been created in the other person's My Drive section, or they may have been shared with you from within another team's Shared Drive. You can manage items in Shared With Me by integrating them into your Drive via shortcut or by removing yourself from the shared item. Since you are not the owner of any files in this section, you cannot delete items or change item ownership. These files do not apply to your total storage. When the owner leaves the college, these files will become unavailable to you unless the owner transfers ownership prior to leaving, or if you have made a copy."

CrashPlan (formerly Code42): Install and Set Up your Cloud Backup Service,https://stolafcarleton.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2092/Carleton/KB/ArticleDet?ID=134263,"Carleton College uses CrashPlan to backup files and other data on college-owned computers. Note: CrashPlan was previously known as Code42 and is currently in the process of transitioning the name of its product. You may see either ""CrashPlan"" or ""Code42"" depending on the application screen you look at. Currently the application still labels itself Code42 most of the time. (Winter 2023) Install CrashPlan/Code42 Look for Code42 in either K1000 or Jamf Self Service Mac: Install Software using Jamf Self-Service (link opens in a new window) Windows: Install Software using K1000 User Self Service (link opens in a new window) Carleton cannot offer Code42 for personally-owned computers. Set up your CrashPlan/Code42 backups You will need to log into Code42 to activate the initial backup. Some upgrades to the client software require you to log in again in the future, but after initial login you shouldn't have to log in regularly. Find the Crashplan Application in Launchpad or the Applications folder in Finder and open it It will open on a log in screen, the username box should already be filled in with your full Carleton email address Do not enter your password After a few seconds you'll be redirected to the regular Carleton login screen in your browser. You may be signed into the browser already, in which case the page will redirect to the next screen. Enter your regular Carleton username and password If this is your first time logging in on this computer, Code42 may present you with a choice to either Add New Device or else Replace Existing device. Replace Existing means that Code42 will have you indicate a previous computer that you wish to basically duplicate onto this new computer. It will then pull all the saved files and settings that it backed up from the old computer and put them onto this new computer. Add New Device means that you'll start a brand new backup file with Code42. You'll be able to use the Restore Files feature to selectively bring files to your new computer from a previous computer. Be aware: it can take several days to pull all your data from a previous machine down from CrashPlan/Code42's storage to your computer. It can be a good idea to leave your computer plugged in and turned on while you're waiting for this initial backup/restore process to finish. Tips By default, Crashplan will not back up your Dropbox or Google Drive files, since these are already backed up to the their respective cloud servers macOS 10.14 and 10.15 may require special permissions for Code42 to backup your files. See the Code42 Support article on this topic for more information. ITS Helpdesk professional staff members can verify whether your computer is backing up to Code42 servers Data Security and Privacy Files containing protected data (Social Security numbers, etc.) must not be backed up with the default Code42 settings. There are two ways to address this issue: Exclude all sensitive files from backup This is appropriate for small amounts of data in well-known locations; but of course, they will not be backed up. Protect all files backed up from your computer with an additional archive passphrase. This is the more secure option, but it means that no one (including the ITS Helpdesk) can recover your files without your passphrase. To enable this additional level of security, open the Code42 application and visit the Settings > Security tab. If you opt to secure your Code42 backups, do not lose your passphrase . By default, Code42 backups are not encrypted. For more details, see Code42's discussion of security options . If you are concerned about the security of Code42 or its infrastructure, we encourage you to come talk to us about your options. Need Help?

REMOTELABS: Connection & Usage,https://stolafcarleton.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2092/Carleton/KB/ArticleDet?ID=137183,"If you haven't already done so, please install the REMOTELABS connection on your computer . Connecting Note : If you have anti-virus or anti-malware applications installed on your computer, they may block the REMOTELAB application. You should be able to manage your blocked/allowed applications from within your antivirus application settings. For example: Avast instructions on managing blocked/allowed applications Malwarebytes instructions on ""excluding detections"" Connect to the GlobalProtect VPN Open the Carleton Remote Labs program in your Applications folder (macOS), from the shortcut on your desktop (Windows) or by searching for the application Check the text in the bottom-left corner to confirm that you are connected to Carleton's network Select your preferred operating system (macOS or Windows) by clicking on the corresponding icon - a green check mark will appear indicating your choice Enter your Carleton username and password Click Request Connection It will take a few moments to establish the connection, perhaps as long as 60-90 seconds.  While this is happening, the ""Remote Host"" field in the bottom-left will show what machine you are being connected to e.g. ""Connecting to REMOTELAB..."" Technician Note: The Tetrad can run scripts if a Windows session won't load. Use Performance Things may seem slow, depending on your internet connection, network traffic, and load on the REMOTELAB system. If you are on a Windows machine controlling a REMOTELAB computer running macOS, this can also be slow. Sound There is no sound on the REMOTELABS. Sound is not passed over a remote connection.  If you need to work with sound in an application, you will need to install it on your personal computer. Printing and Scanning If you have a printer or scanner connected to your personal computer, you will not be able to access them within a REMOTELAB computer. Printing and scanning from a REMOTELAB computer to a campus printer/scanner is also not supported Saving Your Data Any files that you want to save should be uploaded to Google Drive, Dropbox, or your cloud service of choice before you log out of the computer.  Because these are shared use machines, Google Drive and Dropbox are only accessible through a web browser. If you save files to the Scratch Disk, remember to upload them to the cloud before you log out.  There is no guarantee that you'll be able to connect back to that same computer later to retrieve data left behind. Logging Out When you are finished using a REMOTELAB computer, log off and close your screen sharing window. IMPORTANT: These are refreshing computers, any changes you made or any files you made will disappear when you log off. Be sure to save what you need on the cloud and log out to protect your data from the next person who uses it. macOS Select Log out Lab User from the Apple Menu Close your Screen Sharing Window Windows Click on the Start Menu and click the Restart icon Close your ScreenSharing Window Note to ITS Staff: Tickets can be assigned to the Helpdesk for basic troubleshooting and Desktop Systems for deep troubleshooting/repair."

Most deployments will occur at the ITS Helpdesk on the main floor of the CMC . If you need to request a different location, please update your hardware deployment ticket. During your deployment at the CMC we will discuss delivery/pickup of other peripherals (monitor, keyboard, laptop stand, etc.) as needed. What to expect during your appointment You'll connect to eduroam on the new device You'll connect to the GlobalProtect VPN on your new device We'll add any printers (link opens in a new tab) you normally use so that you can print to them from your new device You'll connect Adobe Creative Cloud on your new device, if you have a license (link opens in a new tab) You'll connect Crashplan/Code 42 on your new device We'll discuss data transfer options from your old device to your new device. After your deployment Depending on what we discussed regarding peripherals and data transfers, we may be coming to your office directly after the appointment, or you may need to schedule another appointment. In either case we'll plan to follow up after about a week to see how things are going. If you're a current faculty or staff member we'll want to coordinate getting your old device recovered by ITS. However, this will only happen once you've confirmed you've been able to transfer all the data you need."

Xerox: Secured Printing,https://stolafcarleton.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2092/Carleton/KB/ArticleDet?ID=146879,"What is Secured Printing? On most Xerox printers, it is possible to send a confidential, ""secure print"" job, to use the industry term. A secure print job is held at the device until you arrive to release it, entering the PIN number you put in when you created the job. This is useful for documents that you don't want others to see, or for large documents that you don't want to hog the printer until you can arrive to babysit. Whether you can use Secure Print with a particular Xerox printer depends on the model of the printer (usually, whether it has a hard drive or RAM drive in it, and up-to-date firmware), and the printer driver (and operating system) on the computer from which you are sending the print job. (Printing must be done directly from a client computer; WebPrint will not work.) Windows client computers always use the Xerox Global Print Driver (X-GPD) PostScript installed from the print server. Mac client computers install printer drivers via the Jamf Self-Service (link opens in a new tab) . Here is an idea of which Xerox models might support Secure Print on each platform, but check your specific printer to be sure Supported on Windows: -X3600, -X3610 (Phaser), -X7760 (Phaser), -XC600 (VersaLink) Not Supported on Windows: -X5550 (Phaser), -X7500 (Phaser) Secured Printing on Windows In your Windows application, choose to Print. Depending on the application, select a button named ""Print Options"" or ""Preferences"". Choose a Print Setup or Printer Properties button only if you don't see either of the others. You're now seeing the Xerox Global Print Driver (X-GPD), Postscript, printer driver. On the Printing Options tab, change the Job Type to Secure Print... A Secure Print window will pop up asking you for a 1-12 digit Passcode (PIN) for this document. (By default, it contains the last passcode you used with a Xerox printer.) Enter any number you wish (4 digits is nice), and enter it again to confirm, but you must remember it; you won't be able to print the document without it. Leave the Job Name field set to ""Use Document Name"", or else you won't be able to identify this document, and choose OK. Change any other options in the printer driver you want, then choose the OK button to close the driver, then choose the Print button in your application. Secured Printing on Mac Note: You might need to install the latest version of the Mac OS X printer driver for this model for these features to work. In your application, choose the Print option. Select Print using the system dialog Click Layout and switch it to Xerox Features Change Job Type from Normal Print to Secure Print Enter a PIN - make sure you remember this, you will need it to print at the printer. Click Print Releasing a Secured Print Job at the Printer On the printer LCD console panel: On a Phaser 3600 or 3610 , press the Menu button (or Left arrow button?), then the up/down arrows to Walk-Up Features then press OK, then up/down arrows to Secure Print then press OK. On a Phaser 7760 , select Walk-Up Printing then press OK, then select Secure Print Jobs , then press OK. On a VersaLink C600 , press the Home button, then on the LCD console choose Jobs , then Personal & Secure Jobs . Navigate to your username then press OK. Use the numeric keypad or the arrow keys to enter your passcode (PIN) then press OK. Select the desired job then use the arrow keys to select options (Print, or Delete after Print) and answer prompts, then press OK. After the job prints, press the physical Start/Stop or Cancel buttons to return the printer to Ready mode."

"FlexWork: Communication, Calendars, and Setting Shared Expectations",https://stolafcarleton.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2092/Carleton/KB/ArticleDet?ID=137230,"Many Carleton Faculty and Staff are used to determining availability by looking for a person at their office or workstation. Not only will colleagues not necessarily be working from their desk, but if the colleague is at a desk they may actually be in a meeting or otherwise not available for interruption. Here are some ways to set and check people's availability for hybrid and remote teams. Develop Shared Expectations with Your Team There are lots of communication tools and settings available , so make sure that you and your team have a shared understanding on things like: How you'll signal to each other that you're busy vs. interruptable What types of communication work best for your team over email, phone, chat, zoom, etc. Will you use Chat or the phone for quick/immediate things while using email for things that have longer timeframes? Are there times when you'll need to rely on asynchronous communication (such as email) as opposed to synchronous communication (such as phone or zoom conversations)? Are there things that should happen over email so that there's a record of the communication? Are there things that should happen by phone or with Chat history turned off so that there's no data retained from the conversation? How will you distinguish between routine vs urgent communications How will you acknowledge that you've received messages when you don't have time to respond fully right away Remember that just like in the physical office, there are many reasons why a colleague may not be at their computer or available to talk at a given moment. Shared expectations will help foster healthy communication rhythms for hybrid and remote teams. Calendar Tips Calendars are powerful communication tools! At a minimum, they can signal to your colleagues when you are unavailable for other conversation. You can set up your Calendar to list your default work hours and location so that colleagues are alerted if they try to invite you to an event outside of your work hours You can use built-in RSVP options in Google Calendar to indicate whether you'll attend the event in person or remotely Event hosts, include a remote option whenever possible, and if attendees respond that they will attend remotely when there is no remote option, communicate with them about their needs and any available options for the meeting. Consider developing a standard way of naming Calendar events so that all attendees know whether an event is on site, hybrid, or virtual. Everyone at Carleton can see your free/busy time (but no event details unless your events or your calendar have been designated Public), so you can check a colleague's calendar to see whether it indicates that they are busy You can manage the visibility of individual events that you created You can share your calendar details with other people who need to see more about what you're doing When you're out of the office, let your calendar help you manage event invitations (scroll down on that page to the Out of Office options) You can integrate Zoom and your Calendar by installing a free plugin Setting your Availability Status Availability statuses help your colleagues know whether they can reach you. In Google Chat and Gmail you can set your availability status , including custom statuses that you determine Not available for a phone all? Set your phone extension to Do Not Disturb Out of Office Notifications When you're unavailable, help your colleagues know that you won't be responding quickly: let your calendar help you manage event invitations (scroll down on that page to the Out of Office options) set up an Out of Office email responder Set a temporary voicemail greeting on Zulu or your Grandstream phone to alert people that you may be delayed in answering voicemail messages Send a Quick Message There's nothing like a quick ""Are you available to chat for a second?"" message sent in Google Chat or email, depending on what your colleagues use as their preferred immediate communication method. Some people may look available because they're sitting quietly at their desk, but they're actually in a meeting or otherwise not interruptable."
Preparing to Work from Off Campus,https://stolafcarleton.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2092/Carleton/KB/ArticleDet?ID=137075,"There are many reasons for working from off campus. You may be a hybrid or remote work employee, or you may simply be in an airport or coffee shop. Whatever the reason, here are some preparations to make so that your technology functions for you while you're off campus. Before You Work Off Campus Make sure you have the VPN installed and functioning properly Back up your computer's files Store any files you'll need to use in the Cloud for easy access and continuous backup Know about your Internet connection Write down your Internet Service Provider's name and phone number, as well as your account number, in case of Internet outages Consider your computer equipment Request a Zulu Softphone account Talk with your team about communication patterns Need Help?

Best Practices for Inclusive Meetings in Zoom or Google Meet,https://stolafcarleton.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2092/Carleton/KB/ArticleDet?ID=137443,"Host Guidance Add That Link! Remember to add a video conferencing link to your meeting invitation when setting up hybrid or remote meetings Space to speak: Create deliberate pauses and time to ask questions for members in person and remote. It may be difficult for a remote member to chime in quickly, so create a space where it is clear that questions/comments are welcome. Take Turns: When asking a question of the group, sometimes you can ask everyone in the meeting to provide a response by going around to call on each individual. To make this more engaging, you can ask a person to “pass” to someone else when they’re done. You’re on camera: When conducting a hybrid meeting, have both the in-person and remote attendees on screen if possible. If your conference room is not equipped with a camera, consult with ITS about room or technology options, or else ask in-person attendees to bring their laptops and also join zoom video. Be sure people in the physical room only join video, not audio, or else multiple audio sources will cause feedback. Respect people’s decisions not to be on camera when remote. There are many possible technical and environmental reasons for these decisions. Running Late? Communicate! If you are going to be late starting the meeting, send a message to attendees to standby. Remote attendees have no way of knowing what is happening in the room and may think the meeting has been cancelled. Be Proactive: Whenever possible, share a meeting agenda ahead of time. If there are materials you need people to review, send them with ample time to review. Attach them to the meeting invitation whenever possible. This will allow your attendees to be well prepared and be able to participate more fully. BYOD (Bring Your Own Device): Hosts should bring their own laptop to conference rooms. Even if the room has a computer in it, you are most familiar with your own set-up and will be able to facilitate meetings more smoothly. Pre-flight check: Test your technology ahead of time so your meeting runs smoothly. You never know when something might need to be updated or, if you just attended a virtual meeting on a different meeting platform, your mic and speaker may need to be readjusted. Tools of engagement: Make virtual meetings more engaging and inclusive by using interactive tools such as polling, chat, or Jamboards to encourage participation for remote and in-person members.  Consult with ITS about how technology can help make your meetings more inclusive. Attendee Guidance RSVP with note: When responding to a meeting invitation, please indicate whether you will be attending virtually or in person . Consider your background: Visual Backgrounds: If you have a lot of visual distraction or a private space in your camera's view, consider a virtual background but keep in mind that virtual backgrounds can be distracting too if they are busy or the camera has trouble distinguishing where you end and your room begins.  Zoom and Meet have a “blur background” option which simply blurs your real life background. Audio Backgrounds: Choose a place that is separate from where other people will be talking whenever possible. Shared office environments are difficult sound environments both for you and for your office mates. If you're in a place where you can't control your background noise, be sure to stay muted whenever you're not speaking so that Zoom doesn't accidentally choose your background noise over other participants when deciding which sounds to share to everyone in the meeting. Cross-talking: Sometimes there is a slight delay for remote meeting members. Take pauses to prevent cross-talking. Where is my microphone? Stay close enough to your microphone so everyone can hear you clearly. If your conference room doesn’t have a reliable microphone, consult with ITS. Shhhhh! Mute when you’re not speaking or when there is background noise.  This is especially important in larger meetings (10+ participants).  At the same time, for smaller meetings, staying unmuted can help foster an easier flow of conversation. You’re on mute. While it’s courteous to mute when you’re not speaking, be ready to unmute at any time and be sure you’re unmuted before speaking. Camera On? For small meetings with a lot of interactivity, having your camera on creates a more inclusive experience.  For large meetings with a primary purpose of listening, having the camera off is reasonable – consider adding a picture of yourself to your profile. You may also need to turn your camera off if your Internet connection is poor.

Computer Equipment for Your Home Office,https://stolafcarleton.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2092/Carleton/KB/ArticleDet?ID=137181,"Typical Equipment for the Home Office Your Carleton Laptop NOTE: If you work with sensitive data, you must use a Carleton-managed computer or petition for an exception to that policy. Laptop Stand External Monitor External Keyboard Mouse Good network connectivity Possibly a printer Equipment Recommendations Here is a list of the equipment that ITS typically deploys to Carleton offices and workspaces . If you are looking for equipment for your home office, that list will provide a good starting place. For a number of people, the largest hurdle to working from a laptop is the size of the screen.  Carleton buys laptops with 13” screens and that’s simply not a lot of space to display the number of windows we typically want to be able to see at once.  Purchasing a good external monitor can greatly improve your hybrid or remote work experience. Carleton typically purchases Dell Ultrasharp monitors, specifically the Ultrasharp U2419H.  These are 24” monitors with very little visible bezel (the plastic bits that run around the outside of the screen area), good brightness, good color representation, and a crisp visual display. However, you may have issues finding these monitors in stock due to the current global supply chain issues. When purchasing a monitor, the three biggest things to consider are the brightness level, the resolution, and the types of connectors it has. ITS looks for a brightness level of at least 200-250 “nits,” which is a unit of brightness measure (specifically, a nit is roughly the amount of light per square meter that an average candle produces; what is an “average candle” is left as an exercise for the reader). For 24” monitors, we look for a resolution of at least 1920x1080 (Full HD).  Generally, as the screen size increases, you want the resolution to also increase; for a 27” monitor, we recommend a resolution of 2560x1440.  Higher resolution basically means each individual pixel is smaller, which results in crisper-looking text. Monitors connect via a number of different types of connections, and you can generally use adapters to get from one kind of connection to another. We recommend getting a monitor that has an HDMI connection; that’s one that looks like this: Image from Wikimedia Commons"
Conferencing for Hybrid Teams: Audio and Video Setup,https://stolafcarleton.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2092/Carleton/KB/ArticleDet?ID=137455,"When remote staff join a meeting where others are together in a conference room, you need a way to see and hear each other. One of the big differences is whether each attendee has a computer or whether you are using a camera and display at one point in the room and focusing the conversation around that focus point. Everyone has a laptop: One option is for every person to have a laptop and to connect to a Zoom or Google Meet session so that the pictures are the same size, so the focus is on each other (rather than a camera at the end of the room) and to facilitate sharing documents. The in-person attendees would need to mute their audio (both mic and speakers) to avoid feedback, and one person in the meeting room should leave their speakers on so that everyone in the room can hear what is said by remote attendees. Everyone has a laptop and there is an external speaker available: A fairly low-cost way to improve the sound is to use an external microphone/speaker system, like a Jabra 710 in your conference room. If you do not have conferencing equipment, here are instructions on finding and requesting that equipment for your team .  One attendee will connect to the Jabra using a USB cable or by bluetooth. That person will need to set their sound settings. In Zoom, you do this by clicking on the “up arrow” next to the word “Mute” and to select the Jabra as the Microphone and the Speaker (as shown below). Using in-room camera and display: If you’re using a room that has an installed display and camera at the front, often called a “huddle room” or a conference room, this will be your Zoom connection for the in-person attendees. One person in the room will need to log into Zoom on a computer which is connected to the in-room display and camera. Some rooms will require an attendee to bring their own laptop and connect the display and camera through an HDMI cable, while others may come with a podium computer. This computer will be how in-room participants will hear and see the remote side. Remote participants will see a single picture of the huddle space that is a bit farther away (than individual boxes in Zoom), but still close enough to see faces and expressions. Need Help? If you have questions about video conferencing during a hybrid meeting, please contact peps@carleton.edu ."
Conferencing for Hybrid Teams: Conference-Ready Rooms,https://stolafcarleton.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2092/Carleton/KB/ArticleDet?ID=137446,"Many departments have their own conference-ready rooms (often called ""huddle rooms"") that have a webcam, microphone, and speaker setup to connect in-person attendees with remote attendees.

Improving Home WiFi Connections,https://stolafcarleton.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2092/Carleton/KB/ArticleDet?ID=136958,"Whether you’re at home, a coffee shop, an airport, or an international location, the quality of your Internet connection makes the biggest difference in how well you can work remotely. Your own Internet Service Provider (ISP) will be the most helpful for troubleshooting Internet problems at your house, but here are some general tips for setting yourself up for good Internet connections. Check your Internet connection speeds We recommend SpeedTest (or the SpeedTest iOS/Android app) for good, free Internet speed checking. If it is connected, disconnect your VPN Go to speedtest.net (link opens in a new window) Below the big GO button you'll see your internet provider listed on the left, and a server name on the right with a ""Change Server"" link below it. Click Change Server and then search for Carleton College . This will help you see how fast your connection to Carleton will be. Click the big round GO button to begin the test Here are the results to look for: less than 75 milliseconds for Ping time 15 megabits per second (Mb/s) or more for Download speed 5 megabits per second (Mb/s) or more for Upload speed Improve your Internet Connection Your Internet Service Provider (ISP) is your best contact for improving your Internet connection. Here are some tips that may help you. If possible, connect using an Ethernet cable rather than WiFi. This will be your fastest, most reliable connection option. Many WiFi routers come with 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz options. 2.4 GHz is slower, but also steadier, better able to pass through walls, and better able to support multiple WiFi connections at once. If you are physically near your router, the 5 GHz option may work better for you, but experiment in your own environment to see whether one option or the other offers the most stable connection. WiFi doesn't travel through all materials equally. People, appliances, electronics can block more signal than regular walls, for example. Try removing obstructions or changing your position so that there are as few obstructions (including your own body) between the WiFi router and your computer. Consider installing a newer WiFi router or a WiFi mesh network that covers your home with multiple access points. WiFi signal repeaters may also be useful to spread signal to areas farther away from your router. The Wirecutter by The New York Times regularly tests and recommends WiFi access points and mesh hardware. Consider changing your local ISP or your service package with your ISP if there are multiple options available in your area Cable and Fiber options are faster and more reliable than DSL A Cellular Hotspot may work depending on your area's cellular coverage, your provider's bandwidth/data restrictions, and your computing needs Satellite and dial-up are generally insufficient for remote work Maintain your network security Your ISP or even your specific WiFi router should provide you with instructions on securing your home network. We recommend working with them to ensure that you are using: a secure admin password on your router (used to get into and configure router settings) a secure WiFi password (used to connect your devices to the WiFi) WPA3 or WPA2 encryption (WPA and WEP options are less secure) You can also improve your security on your computer. This should be done in addition to securing your home WiFi network. Use the Carleton VPN whenever you're connected to the Internet Note that you MUST use the VPN and a Carleton-issued computer if you work with sensitive data such as student or financial date ( more information about data management and security ) Make sure your computer's operating system is up to date Make sure that core applications (Microsoft Office, Chrome, Firefox, Adobe, Zoom, etc) are up to date Turn on automatic updates for your operating system and your software applications Run anti-virus and anti-malware scans Note that Carleton does not provide software for privately owned computers.

Troubleshooting Home WiFi Problems,https://stolafcarleton.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2092/Carleton/KB/ArticleDet?ID=137079,"If your home WiFi seems sluggish or inconsistent, check out our article on Improving Home WiFi Connections . If you've had good WiFi in the past but experience sudden changes in performance, here are some things to try: If a microwave is running, that could easily disrupt your signal. Wait till it is done and try again. Unplug both your modem and your WiFi router (if they are separate devices). Wait for 10 seconds, and then plug them back in. Wait for them to turn on and establish their connections (can take a minute or more). Make sure all cables (ethernet and power cables, usually) are fully connected to the modem and/or router, pressing them in securely Check to see if another device in your house (phones, gaming consols, iPads, streaming services, TVs, smart devices) are doing bandwidth-intensive activities (moving lots of data, especially video data). Turn them off if possible. Connect your computer to your modem with an ethernet cable Call your Internet Service Provider (it's a good idea to have their phone number pre-programmed into your phone or written down somewhere, along with your account information)"

Zoom: Tips and Tricks for Zoom Meetings,https://stolafcarleton.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2092/Carleton/KB/ArticleDet?ID=137331&SIDs=10309,"Getting Started Zoom has a user guide for new users and a whole set of Video Tutorials Explore and set your preferences There are preferences in the Zoom application itself that you can set for your preferred way of using zoom There are many more preferences available in your Zoom Profile Online Look through Zoom's list of Meeting and Webinar Best Practices You may be able to reduce Zoom fatigue by turning off your view of your own video Your Audio and Video Audio tips You can see which microphone Zoom is using by clicking on the little triangle near the microphone button (lower left of the screen). If you intend to use a headset but Zoom is still using your computer's built-in speakers, for example, this is how you can change your microphone. Zoom selects one participant at a time when it's sharing audio, so it doesn't work well to have two people try to talk at the same time, or to have background noises from one participant ""interrupt"" another participant. Try to make it so that only one microphone at a time needs to be transmitting sound to the group. Choose a place that is separate from where other people will be talking whenever possible. Shared office environments are difficult sound environments both for you and for your office mates. If you're in a place where you can't control your background noise, be sure to stay muted whenever you're not speaking so that Zoom doesn't accidentally choose your background noise over other participants when deciding which sounds to share to everyone in the meeting. Zoom has advice for managing audio echos in meetings Video tips While joining a meeting with your camera on allows for easier collegial interactions, it's not always the best choice. If you have an unstable or slow internet connection, turning off your video can improve your Zoom connection. If you have a lot of visual distraction or a private space in your camera's view, consider a virtual background but keep in mind that virtual backgrounds can be distracting too if they are busy or the camera has trouble distinguishing where you end and your room begins.

CrashPlan (formerly Code42): Install and Set Up your Cloud Backup Service,https://stolafcarleton.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2092/Carleton/KB/ArticleDet?ID=134263&SIDs=10320,"Carleton College uses CrashPlan to backup files and other data on college-owned computers. Note: CrashPlan was previously known as Code42 and is currently in the process of transitioning the name of its product. You may see either ""CrashPlan"" or ""Code42"" depending on the application screen you look at. Currently the application still labels itself Code42 most of the time. (Winter 2023) Install CrashPlan/Code42 Look for Code42 in either K1000 or Jamf Self Service Mac: Install Software using Jamf Self-Service (link opens in a new window) Windows: Install Software using K1000 User Self Service (link opens in a new window) Carleton cannot offer Code42 for personally-owned computers. Set up your CrashPlan/Code42 backups You will need to log into Code42 to activate the initial backup. Some upgrades to the client software require you to log in again in the future, but after initial login you shouldn't have to log in regularly. Find the Crashplan Application in Launchpad or the Applications folder in Finder and open it It will open on a log in screen, the username box should already be filled in with your full Carleton email address Do not enter your password After a few seconds you'll be redirected to the regular Carleton login screen in your browser. You may be signed into the browser already, in which case the page will redirect to the next screen. Enter your regular Carleton username and password If this is your first time logging in on this computer, Code42 may present you with a choice to either Add New Device or else Replace Existing device. Replace Existing means that Code42 will have you indicate a previous computer that you wish to basically duplicate onto this new computer. It will then pull all the saved files and settings that it backed up from the old computer and put them onto this new computer. Add New Device means that you'll start a brand new backup file with Code42. You'll be able to use the Restore Files feature to selectively bring files to your new computer from a previous computer. Be aware: it can take several days to pull all your data from a previous machine down from CrashPlan/Code42's storage to your computer. It can be a good idea to leave your computer plugged in and turned on while you're waiting for this initial backup/restore process to finish. Tips By default, Crashplan will not back up your Dropbox or Google Drive files, since these are already backed up to the their respective cloud servers macOS 10.14 and 10.15 may require special permissions for Code42 to backup your files. See the Code42 Support article on this topic for more information. ITS Helpdesk professional staff members can verify whether your computer is backing up to Code42 servers Data Security and Privacy Files containing protected data (Social Security numbers, etc.) must not be backed up with the default Code42 settings. There are two ways to address this issue: Exclude all sensitive files from backup This is appropriate for small amounts of data in well-known locations; but of course, they will not be backed up. Protect all files backed up from your computer with an additional archive passphrase. This is the more secure option, but it means that no one (including the ITS Helpdesk) can recover your files without your passphrase. To enable this additional level of security, open the Code42 application and visit the Settings > Security tab. If you opt to secure your Code42 backups, do not lose your passphrase . By default, Code42 backups are not encrypted. For more details, see Code42's discussion of security options . If you are concerned about the security of Code42 or its infrastructure, we encourage you to come talk to us about your options. Need Help?

Moodle: Introduction for Students,https://stolafcarleton.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2092/Carleton/KB/ArticleDet?ID=137542&SIDs=10334,"Moodle is Carleton’s online classroom where faculty can send messages to students and post resources and assignments. The Dashboard The dashboard shows blocks. The default block is the calendar block but you can certainly customize the dashboard. To do so, click add block and choose any block type you would like to add. In order to delete a block, click the gear icon on the top right hand corner of the block and choose Delete [Block Name] block. Course Pages Faculty customize their own Moodle pages, so no two courses look exactly alike. Most courses have pages organized by week, with assignments appearing under their week's title. If you have questions about a course Moodle page, the first person to take questions to would be your professor. Gradebook Not all classes maintain a gradebook on Moodle, but some do. Do not worry if you don’t have grades displayed for any or all of your courses. The gradebook can be found on the top of the left sidebar while looking at a course page. Assignments The assignment page can have instructions about the assignment along with files the professor has uploaded (e.g. a PDF with the instructions). You can add, edit, or remove your assignment submissions below the assignment details. If you’re adding a file, you can upload the file from your computer or Google Drive or drag and drop the file in. If you’re editing your submission, you can delete files or add them using the buttons above the file submission box. Removing a submission will delete the file. If you edit your submission, the time you did this is logged as the new submission time even if it’s after the due date. When professors have provided feedback, scroll to the bottom of the page to find the feedback text or file. Questions? Click on the Request Service button on the upper right of this page.

A while later, check your Carleton email for a new message from Microsoft that may look like the following, with a subject like, ""Check out this special discount, just for you"" (sounds like spam, doesn't it?). The Web browser link under the blue button really is customized just for you (hence your name in the message), and must not be shared. It will take you to a Microsoft login page, where there is one tricky step: Now you must login with a personal, non-Carleton, email address, which will be your Microsoft account.

Remember to add a video conferencing link to your meeting invitation when setting up hybrid or remote meetings Space to speak: Create deliberate pauses and time to ask questions for members in person and remote. It may be difficult for a remote member to chime in quickly, so create a space where it is clear that questions/comments are welcome. Take Turns: When asking a question of the group, sometimes you can ask everyone in the meeting to provide a response by going around to call on each individual. To make this more engaging, you can ask a person to “pass” to someone else when they’re done. You’re on camera: When conducting a hybrid meeting, have both the in-person and remote attendees on screen if possible. If your conference room is not equipped with a camera, consult with ITS about room or technology options, or else ask in-person attendees to bring their laptops and also join zoom video. Be sure people in the physical room only join video, not audio, or else multiple audio sources will cause feedback. Respect people’s decisions not to be on camera when remote. There are many possible technical and environmental reasons for these decisions. Running Late? Communicate! If you are going to be late starting the meeting, send a message to attendees to standby. Remote attendees have no way of knowing what is happening in the room and may think the meeting has been cancelled. Be Proactive: Whenever possible, share a meeting agenda ahead of time. If there are materials you need people to review, send them with ample time to review. Attach them to the meeting invitation whenever possible. This will allow your attendees to be well prepared and be able to participate more fully. BYOD (Bring Your Own Device): Hosts should bring their own laptop to conference rooms. Even if the room has a computer in it, you are most familiar with your own set-up and will be able to facilitate meetings more smoothly. Pre-flight check: Test your technology ahead of time so your meeting runs smoothly. You never know when something might need to be updated or, if you just attended a virtual meeting on a different meeting platform, your mic and speaker may need to be readjusted. Tools of engagement: Make virtual meetings more engaging and inclusive by using interactive tools such as polling, chat, or Jamboards to encourage participation for remote and in-person members.  Consult with ITS about how technology can help make your meetings more inclusive. Attendee Guidance RSVP with note: When responding to a meeting invitation, please indicate whether you will be attending virtually or in person . Consider your background: Visual Backgrounds: If you have a lot of visual distraction or a private space in your camera's view, consider a virtual background but keep in mind that virtual backgrounds can be distracting too if they are busy or the camera has trouble distinguishing where you end and your room begins.  Zoom and Meet have a “blur background” option which simply blurs your real life background. Audio Backgrounds: Choose a place that is separate from where other people will be talking whenever possible. Shared office environments are difficult sound environments both for you and for your office mates. If you're in a place where you can't control your background noise, be sure to stay muted whenever you're not speaking so that Zoom doesn't accidentally choose your background noise over other participants when deciding which sounds to share to everyone in the meeting. Cross-talking: Sometimes there is a slight delay for remote meeting members. Take pauses to prevent cross-talking. Where is my microphone? Stay close enough to your microphone so everyone can hear you clearly. If your conference room doesn’t have a reliable microphone, consult with ITS. Shhhhh! Mute when you’re not speaking or when there is background noise.  This is especially important in larger meetings (10+ participants).  At the same time, for smaller meetings, staying unmuted can help foster an easier flow of conversation. You’re on mute. While it’s courteous to mute when you’re not speaking, be ready to unmute at any time and be sure you’re unmuted before speaking. Camera On? For small meetings with a lot of interactivity, having your camera on creates a more inclusive experience.  For large meetings with a primary purpose of listening, having the camera off is reasonable – consider adding a picture of yourself to your profile. You may also need to turn your camera off if your Internet connection is poor.

If you intend to use a headset but Zoom is still using your computer's built-in speakers, for example, this is how you can change your microphone. Zoom selects one participant at a time when it's sharing audio, so it doesn't work well to have two people try to talk at the same time, or to have background noises from one participant ""interrupt"" another participant. Try to make it so that only one microphone at a time needs to be transmitting sound to the group. Choose a place that is separate from where other people will be talking whenever possible. Shared office environments are difficult sound environments both for you and for your office mates. If you're in a place where you can't control your background noise, be sure to stay muted whenever you're not speaking so that Zoom doesn't accidentally choose your background noise over other participants when deciding which sounds to share to everyone in the meeting. Zoom has advice for managing audio echos in meetings Video tips While joining a meeting with your camera on allows for easier collegial interactions, it's not always the best choice. If you have an unstable or slow internet connection, turning off your video can improve your Zoom connection. If you have a lot of visual distraction or a private space in your camera's view, consider a virtual background but keep in mind that virtual backgrounds can be distracting too if they are busy or the camera has trouble distinguishing where you end and your room begins.

Updating frequently minimizes the disruption and increases protection against security threats. A restart rather than a shut-down offers the best chance for your computer to run updates. If you need to take your computer with you regularly, or prefer shutting it down when not in use, try one of the following options: Schedule one night a week where you choose to restart rather than shut down Restart when you take lunch each day, or if you have a long meeting that doesn't require your computer For the truly proactive among you: once a month, check for updates manually.

In order to delete a block, click the gear icon on the top right hand corner of the block and choose Delete [Block Name] block. Course Pages Faculty customize their own Moodle pages, so no two courses look exactly alike. Most courses have pages organized by week, with assignments appearing under their week's title. If you have questions about a course Moodle page, the first person to take questions to would be your professor. Gradebook Not all classes maintain a gradebook on Moodle, but some do. Do not worry if you don’t have grades displayed for any or all of your courses. The gradebook can be found on the top of the left sidebar while looking at a course page. Assignments The assignment page can have instructions about the assignment along with files the professor has uploaded (e.g. a PDF with the instructions). You can add, edit, or remove your assignment submissions below the assignment details. If you’re adding a file, you can upload the file from your computer or Google Drive or drag and drop the file in. If you’re editing your submission, you can delete files or add them using the buttons above the file submission box. Removing a submission will delete the file. If you edit your submission, the time you did this is logged as the new submission time even if it’s after the due date.

Moodle: Downloading your Content,https://stolafcarleton.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2092/Carleton/KB/ArticleDet?ID=143875,"Downloading Moodle Content To download material from the current academic year, you simply need to log on to Moodle as normal and access the corresponding courses from your main page. From there, you will be able to download assignments and papers as normal. You will not , however, be able to directly access course content from previous academic years . Accessing this content is non-trivial , so we ask that you seriously consider whether or not you need it. This is especially true during the summer as we simply cannot process requests from all seniors. If you decide that you have an absolute and desperate need for a file from a previous academic year, please make a request as follows: Copies of Your Own Work If you are requesting a copy of your own work (e.g. an assignment hand-in), please request this by opening a Moodle Request Ticket or emailing at@carleton.edu . Please ensure that you have the following information to hand before contacting us - without it, we will not be able to complete the request: The exact course code The exact section number for the course The specific document that you want For example:  psyc100-01-s20, Week 3, first assignment Copies of Assignments If you are requesting a copy of the assignment itself, (i.e. the part that the faculty wrote), you must request that directly from your course's instructor . ITS cannot give out faculty-created/owned content. It's an intellectual property thing. If faculty are unsure how how to access the relevant content, ask them to send you an email explicitly granting you permission to access the material. You can then forward that permission in a request to ITS as outlined above. Acknowledgements Created by Iris Jastram, Mon 6/6/22"
Moodle: Moodle Themes and Formats,https://stolafcarleton.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2092/Carleton/KB/ArticleDet?ID=147163,"Course Themes Moodle Course Themes change the appearance of the course homepage, but navigating around the course remains the same. The carleton Moodle tile has 3 themes. Fordson Fordson is the Carleton default theme. Like any other carleton themes, it  has a navigation page bar at the left hand of the page, but it also has a 3 gear icon that allows you to directly access assignments, quizzes, forums and other course resources. Furthermore, from the top of the page, there is a link to all your courses. Carleton Boost Carleton Boost is the “parent” theme of the Fordon. They share features except that Boost does not have the 3 gear icon and the link to other courses. Moove The Moove theme gives you access to Accessibility settings, where you can change the site color, the font type and the font type. Course Formats Whereas the course themes change the course homepage appearance, course formats alter the way information is displayed on the course page. Weekly Format The Weekly format displays sections with titles as date ranges. Note: instructors can change the title name (for example “Week 1” instead of “12 September - 18 September”). If a week is hidden, you can see that week but not any activities within that week. Topics Course Format The Topics Course Format shows the course sections as distinct topics. Within every topic, you may find some of the activities related to the topic. Sometimes, the instructor will hide sections from students. In that case, the course topic will be visible, but all the activities within the hidden topic will  not be available. When topics are available, click the topic title and the activities will expand under the topic’s title. Buttons Course Format The Buttons Course Format creates buttons (labeled 1-10) for sections. When you click on a button, only the activities for that section will be displayed on the page. All other activities will be hidden behind their corresponding button. Note: In the image below, buttons 8 through 10 have no content under them in this course, so they are unable to be entered.​​​​​​ Flexible Sections Course Format The Flexible Sections Course Format allows teachers to create nested sections under the main course sections; sections with sections. Each section can be either collapsed or expanded. If an instructor chooses to hide a course section, the section will be collapsed and you will not be able to access any sections or activities within that hidden section. Edwiser Course Format The Edwiser Course Format shows course sections as tiles that are customizable for teachers. All the activities that are associated with the section are included in the tile. Tiles Course Format The Tiles Course Format creates a tile for every course section. When you click into a tile, all the activities associated with that tile will appear. Tiles can be hidden or shown to you. If a tile is marked as hidden, you will be able to see the tile but not any activities related to them.

We have our own version of this product at Carleton College called ""CarlSites."" You may have heard these terms tossed around. This article aims to help you gain a better understanding of this service by explaining some of the terms and mapping out how they work with one another. With CarlSites, our students, faculty, and staff can set up their own webspaces to create a digital presence through the use of academic websites. The first step to set up your webspace is to complete our interest form . Then, we will work with you to determine which of the services within CarlSites will meet your needs. Visual Hierarchy Commonly Used Terms CarlSites CarlSites is now the official name of our DoOO instance at Carleton College. You can access the landing page by going to sites.carleton.edu . Domain of One's Own (DoOO) DoOO is a product by Reclaim Hosting. Carleton College owns an instance of DoOO called CarlSites for students, faculty, and staff to create a digital presence through the use of academic websites. Reclaim Reclaim is our shorthand for Reclaim Hosting. Reclaim Hosting is a company that has several products; of these products, Carleton licenses for a Carleton-specific Domain of One's Own. Digital Presence/Webspace A collection of information accessible via a web browser. Domain Simply put, a domain is a website address where you can share your content online. The domain name takes the shape of a url ending in sites.carleton.edu . Subdomain Subdomains act as additional websites with their own unique content without having to register a new domain name. For example: sites.carleton.edu is a domain and blogs.sites.carleton.edu is a subdomain . Subdirectory Subdirectories are very similar to subdomains. They are an alternative for organizing your space; similar to a folder within a folder, though the structure is a little different. If we take the same example from above: sites.carleton.edu is the domain ; the subdirectory will be sites.carleton.edu/blogs . Warning: Creating subdirectories can be tricky if the slug already exists. For example: if a WordPress site uses the url sites.carleton.edu and a blog page was created using the slug sites.carleton.edu/blogs , another WordPress site cannot be installed with the subdirectory name sites.carleton.edu/blogs because the url is already taken. If you try to create a subdirectory of the same name, you’ll get a conflict and errors. Slug A slug is just the ending portion of the url name. It looks like a Subdirectory, but they’re different. A slug is usually added when you create a new page in your sites while a subdirectory can be created when you install a new application. For example, a Wordpress site has a login page. Because that login page is separate from the main page, it needs a slug, which is /wp-login.php/ . So the complete url will look like blogs.sites.carleton.edu/wp-login.php/ . Site Site is shorthand for website; it is the space where you can add and manage the content. Some examples of sites are WordPress and Omeka. Subsite A subsite is a single site that lives within a larger, more powerful site. This term is most often used with a WordPress multisite . For example, a WordPress multisite is used for a class that helps students create their own portfolios. Each student has their single WordPress site to configure (this is the subsite), but all student portfolio sites are managed within a larger, more powerful WordPress site (the main multisite) created by the faculty member. Application The word site and Application are used interchangeably. In the context of cPanel, each site uses a specific application. For example, if you own a WordPress site, a WordPress application has been installed in your cPanel. cPanel cPanel is short for control panel, but it is widely known as a site collection database. Here, you can easily access and manage your domains, subdomains, applications, backups and files of your account. Disk Quota Each cPanel has a set amount of storage space when it is first set up. This is called disk quota, also referred to as disk space. Disk Usage Disk usage refers to a calculation of everything (from files, databases, etc.) that takes up space in the cPanel. Backup A backup is a copy of your application from a specific moment in time. Backups are saved for preservation in case something goes wrong with the current version and the backup needs to be restored in order for the site to work again. Backups can take up a lot of space, so it is recommended you only have 1 backup per application. File Transfer Protocol (FTP) FTP is a method that allows you to remotely move files to a web server from another location – usually your local/personal computer. This is primarily used when multiple people are working within the same cPanel. Questions? If you'd like to create a website using CarlSites, please fill out this website request form .

CarlSites: Getting Started,https://stolafcarleton.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2092/Carleton/KB/ArticleDet?ID=148027,"Table of Contents 1. Getting started 1.1 Choosing your domain name 1.2 Signing up 1.3 Privacy 1.4 What Can You Do with Your Account? 1.5 What Exactly is a Web Application? 1.6 Static and Dynamic Websites 1.7 Technical Requirements/Limitations 2 When you leave 1. Getting Started Carleton College provides students, faculty, and staff with the opportunity to register a domain name and create a digital presence through various mediums such as blogs, portfolios, and wikis using CarlSites . You can easily install open source applications such as WordPress, Omeka, Scalar, and MediaWiki to your own domain, and use this space to create your digital identity and express your creativity. 1.1. Choosing your domain name Choosing your domain name is the first step in getting started with staking your claim on the web. Your domain name is a unique Web address (e.g. yourname.sites.carleton.edu) that can be used to build out your own digital presence. As you make your choice, there are a few considerations to keep in mind: Your Domain Name Must Be Available : Domain names must be unique, which means in order for you to claim your own, you need to be sure that it is currently available (and not being used by anyone else or any company or organization). There are lots of tools to check on domain availability, and when you sign up on sites.carleton.edu, we’ll actually check the availability of your choice for you. If you’d like to spend some time thinking about your choice and checking availability before you actually sign-up, we recommend using whois.com . Choose a Domain You Can Live With : You should choose a domain name that you feel you can live with for quite some time. You should pick something that you won’t find embarrassing in the future . A good rule of thumb is to pick a domain that you would be comfortable putting on a future job application. You May Wish to Include Your Name in Your Domain : There is no requirement that your domain reflects your specific identity in the form of your first and last name. However, choosing a domain name that includes your name may make it easier for you to achieve higher rankings in search engines when someone queries your real name. Pick a Domain you Like : At the end of the day, your domain should reflect you. Pick a domain you like and are proud of. It can reflect your interests, sports you play, or your hobby. Or it could just be your name. The “right” domain for you is the one you’re comfortable with. 1.2. Signing Up Review the Guidelines Before you get started, please review our CarlSites Domain Ownership Agreement . Getting Setup Once you’ve reviewed the guidelines, download a copy to your device Sign, date, and rename the file to include your first and last name You can proceed to fill out this interest form and email your signed agreement to at@carleton.edu. Scroll to the bottom of the page and fill out the Request Form. Additional Domain Name Options If you would like a different domain name, there are 2 additional options. Please indicate in the interest form if you are interested in the options outlined below. Buy a top-level domain from Reclaim Hosting: It is easy to create your own top-level domain. This allows you to select a URL for your website that is easy to remember and share. While you are at Carleton, this is available for a nominal cost (currently $15/year). You can continue to use this domain after leaving CarlSites, although the cost may increase. Connect an existing domain to your cPanel: If you already have an existing domain that you’ve previously registered elsewhere, simply point your domain’s nameservers to ns1.reclaimhosting.com and ns2.reclaimhosting.com . 1.3 Privacy What you add to your sites.carleton.edu webspace rests entirely with you. You can choose not to pick a domain that reveals your name. You can use a pseudonym on your actual site. However, when you sign up through the default process, your name does get published as part of the public record about your domain name. Anyone can find it by looking up details about the ownership of that domain name through a public “Whois” request. This is NOT an issue if you’re already planning on using your name openly on your site (in your domain name or elsewhere). This option is aimed, specifically, at those who, for whatever reason, feel they want to take every precaution to hide their identity on their site. 1.4 What Can You Do with Your Account? Your ability to do things on CarlSites is dictated to a large degree by the limits of your imagination. That said, there are some technical requirements and limitations that you should be aware of and might want to review. To spark your imagination, here are some ideas that might help you get started: Install a Web Application in Your Space CarlSites makes it very simple to install certain Web applications in your Web space. Web applications are just special software that run on a web server. Usually, they allow you to build and manage a website. The kind of site you can build depends on the type of application you install. Here are some examples of applications that you can easily install within the sites.carleton.edu web hosting interface: WordPress : WordPress is a simple-to-use blogging application. The tool also comes with a huge array of plugins & themes to allow you to create virtually any kind of website imaginable. Please see the Wordpress portion of our Technical Guide for more information. Omeka: Omeka is an open-source web application that can be used to create and display online digital collections and archives. Please see the Omeka portion of our Technical Guide for more information. Scalar: Scalar is a content management system with the idea of creating non-linear books on the web. Please see the Scalar portion of our Technical Guide for more information. Mediawiki: It is the open-source wiki software that runs the online encyclopedia, Wikipedia . This tool may be right for you if you’re interested in publishing documents and then collaborating with others on them. Please see the Mediawiki portion of our Technical Guide for more information. These are just a few of the open-source applications that are available to you in your CarlSites web space. Organize Your Site with Subdomains and Folders Through this project, you’ve received a domain name that you can actually subdivide and organize anyway you like. One easy way to organize your domain is to create subdomains, in which you can then install other applications. Please see the Setting UP Subdomains portion of our Technical Guide for more information. You can also set up subfolders for your site (which can also have their own applications installed in them). Here’s an example of how you might organize your site (using the subdomain vs. the subfolder approach) Subdomain Approach Subfolder Approach yourdomain.com (“root”) Install WordPress as your “main site” yourdomain.com (“root”) course1.yourdomain.com Install a second WordPress instance for a course you’re taking yourdomain.com/course1 photos.yourdomain.com Install ZenPhoto for a public photo gallery of your photo yourdomain.com/photos docs.yourdomain.com Install MediaWiki for a club you belong to that wants to collaboratively edit its bylaws yourdomain.com/docs files.yourdomain.com Install OwnCloud so you can access your files on your laptop and at work yourdomain.com/file This is just an example of a way to organize your site and then use different sections to do different things. There is no one solution to this challenge, and what you do should be driven by what makes sense to you. To start, you may just want to install one thing at the “root” of your domain, and then let the rest evolve as you get to know more about what’s possible. Map Your Domain (or a Subdomain) If you already have a digital presence that you’d like to pull into your CarlSites space, domain mapping is an option you may wish to explore. This allows you to assign your domain (or a subdomain) to another service. Some services that work with domain mapping are: WordPress.com Google Sites Tumblr Blogger When you map a domain, users who visit your URL will automatically see your space on one of these services. It’s a great way to incorporate your activity elsewhere into your domain, and it might be a good first step if you’ve already established a presence elsewhere and just want to point your new domain to that space. Contact at@carleton.edu if you need assistance setting this up 1.5 What Exactly is a Web Application? In the most general terms, a Web application is a piece of software that runs on a Web server. A Web server is a just a specialized computer designed to host Web pages. Most Web applications are comprised of two components: files and a database. When you install a Web application, you will need to make sure all of the files are copied over into the appropriate location AND that a database (and database user) has been set up to connect to those files. Often, you will have to do some configuration to make sure the application knows how to access the database. The system we use for CarlSites uses a special script installer called Installatron (in cPanel) that allows you to automatically install dozens of open source applications. When you use Installatron, you don’t need to worry about moving files, creating databases, or doing the initial configuration. It’s all taken care of for you. In order to run on the CarlSites server, Web applications must be able to run on a LAMP server, which is the particular kind of Web server that we use. Occasionally, a Web application may require additional components or modules that need to be installed on the server. 1.6 Static and Dynamic Websites Static Websites In the early days of the Web, almost all Web sites were what is known as 'static sites.' Content (text, images, video, audio, etc), was placed or embedded in a file in which HTML (HyperText Markup Language) tags were used to format it. If you looked at the actual contents of the file, you might see something like this: The content and the tags lived side-by-side. To edit the page, you’d open up the file (on your own computer) in a program capable of editing HTML files and make changes to either the content or the presentation. Every page had to be edited individually, even if the edits you were making were for common elements that appeared on many pages (like menu bars). From a technical perspective, accessing a static Web site is fairly straightforward. When your computer is connected to the Internet, you can use a Web browser to access files on a Web server (as long as you know the address). The Web server delivers the contents of those files to your browser, and your browser displays them. Dynamic Websites Over time, as the Web became more sophisticated, new systems emerged for creating and managing Web sites. These moved beyond the model of having content and HTML tags live in a simple HTML page which your browser accessed and displayed. Instead, these systems were Web applications – software that literally runs on the Web server and makes it possible to manage a Web site, often with very sophisticated features. One feature of these applications is that they separate content and presentation by storing most content (your text, images, etc) and data about the site (the title, options, etc). in a database. On the Web server, the Web application installs files that are written in some kind of programming language. The server reads this code and obeys any requests in it to access data in the database (which lives on a separate server) and displays it according to the instructions in the code. Essentially, the data for the site (living in a series of tables in a database on the database server) is entirely separate from the actual presentation of the site (living in the code of the programmed files on the Web server). Special software on both the Web server and the Database server enable the two to speak to each other and work together. One of the benefits of using a Web application is that you usually don’t need to touch (or even look at!) the code in order to make changes to your content. In addition, editing the site usually involves accessing some kind of control panel through your Web browser and filling out a form, instead of having to download and access files in software on your own computer. Dynamic vs Static Content Sometimes when we talk about the difference between dynamic and static content we get bogged down in the idea of whether or not the content is “fresh” (dynamic, regularly updated) or “old” (static, never updated). How frequently you update your content has nothing to do with what kind of system you are using to manage your site. You can manage a static Web site (as described above) and update the content every day. You can also have a dynamic Web site (running something like WordPress) and never change the content after you create it. Generally speaking, it is easier to regularly update content on a dynamic Web site because the Web application just makes it easier. Sometimes, even when you just want a very basic page or placeholder, it’s easier to install a Web application (and only put up a single page) then to manually create an HTML page and upload it. A Side Note about Separating Content from Presentation: Style Sheets Another aspect of separating content from presentation involves the use of 'Cascading Style Sheets' ( CSS ). These are special files that live on your Web server and are linked to your Web pages. They contain information (written in a special markup language) about how to make elements on your site look. For example, they allow you to define in a single location what all Level 1 Headings look like on your site. They are an important aspect of understanding how to separate content from presentation, but they’re not really an aspect of the difference between static and dynamic sites. Both static and dynamic sites can use style sheets. 1.7 Technical Requirements/Limitations CarlSites uses a Web server known as a LAMP server . “LAMP” is an acronym for the technology stack that is installed on the server: L inux: This is the open-source operating system that is used on the server. A pache: This is the Web server software that the server uses. M ySQL: This is the database software that the server uses. P hp/Perl/Python: These are the three programming languages that the server can interpret. Generally, if you are using applications available to install by default through the sites.carleton.edu, you shouldn’t need to worry about these technical details. All of the software that is available for installation (in cPanel) meets the technical requirements. 2 When You Leave There are a few reasons that could lead you to consider exporting your website content from CarlSites. Perhaps you’re leaving the College, or maybe you’re just wanting to use your data on another hosting environment. Whatever the case, you have a couple options. Please see Leaving Carleton - Your Personal/Class Websites for more information. Refer to this article if you would like to export your WordPress content when you leave Carleton college. Questions?

CarlSites: Technical Guide,https://stolafcarleton.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2092/Carleton/KB/ArticleDet?ID=148028,"1. Setting Up FTP There may be times when you need to upload files to your website in the CarlSites web hosting environment. There are a number of scenarios when this might be necessary: You’re working with an application that allows you to install plugins/extensions, but the files need to be manually added to your file manager in order to install them. (Note: This is not required for WordPress which allows you to install themes/plugins through the WordPress dashboard.) You’ve developed a custom site/pages using a Web design program, and you need to upload the files you created to your file manager You’re installing an application that isn’t part of applications list in Installatron . One way to upload files is by using the File Manager that is part of cPanel. However, sometimes you’ll find it easier/necessary to use File Transfer Protocol (FTP) to move files to your site. This can be particularly useful if you’re working with a Web space where you’re not the owner (so you don’t have access to the File Manager in cPanel) or if you need to provide file access to someone else to your space on the Web server. File Manager also only allows you to upload files one by one, so if you’re working with large amounts of data then FTP will be preferable. What exactly is FTP? File Transfer Protocol is a method that allows you to remotely move files to a Web server from another location – usually your local/personal computer. Using a pre-defined FTP account (with a username and password), you can configure an FTP client (a program you run on your computer that allows you to transfer files via FTP. There are lots of FTP clients that you can use; some are free and some are not. A few free ones you might consider: FileZilla (Mac & PC) CyberDuck (Mac & PC) Get Information about Your FTP Account If you’re connecting via FTP to your own space on CarlSites, or if you’re setting up an FTP account for someone else to use, you’ll need to start by getting the proper FTP credentials from cPanel: Login to sites.carleton.edu . In the Search Box at the top of the page, search for FTP, and click the FTP Accountsicon that appears. Every cPanel has an FTP account by default, and you can find those credentials by scrolling down on the FTP Accounts page. You also have the option to create a new FTP account, which can be done by filling out the Add FTP Account form with a username and password. Unless you change it, the new FTP account will be limited to a directory with the same name as the account you’re creating. You can change this to a different directory, if you want to grant this account access to a different location. NOTE: Make sure you know/remember the password you enter. When you’re done, click Create FTP Account . Once you’ve created the new account, you’ll see it appear in the list at the bottom of the FTP Accounts page. In addition to any accounts you’ve created, in the Special FTP Accounts section, you’ll see the default FTP Account. You’ll know this account because the username corresponds to your cPanel username. This FTP account has full privileges to access all directories within your cPanel. For whichever account you need credentials for, click the Configure FTP Client link. Write down the username, server, and port information that appears. You will need to use this (or you will need to provide this to the person you are giving FTP access) along with the password you created in Step 3 in order to configure your FTP client. PLEASE NOTE: For cPanel’s default FTP account, use the following settings: Connect via SFTP (more secure than FTP) Port: 22 For an FTP account that you manually created (shown in Step 3 above), use the following settings: Connect via FTP (cPanel doesn’t allow an SFTP connection for manual accounts) Port: 21 Configure FTP in Your FTP Client Below are links to tutorials for setting up both FileZilla and CyberDuck to connect to your FTP account. FileZilla Configuration Instructions CyberDuck Configuration Instructions For further assistance on FTP, contact Academic Technology (at@carleton.edu). 2. LAMP Environments Here are a few things you need to know about the Web host that will make it easier to understand what you can do with your new space. The Web Server The Web server is the main computer that is associated with the sites.carleton.edu hosting account. It is literally a computer that has special software on it that allows it to be accessible via the Web. The files that run your applications, images, video, or any other files you upload into your Web space are stored on this server. (For comparison’s sake, your desktop or laptop computer, by default, doesn’t allow this; I can’t access files on your computer through a Web browser by default. You can actually install Web server software on your own computer, however, essentially making your files accessible over the Web.) In order to run properly, a Web server has to have an operating system installed and some kind of Web server software. Our CarlSites hosting environment runs the LINUX operating system and an APACHE Web server. The Database Server In addition to the Web server, there is also an associated database server. This is another computer, but it is configured with software that allows it to host databases. It is also connected to your Web server so that your applications (hosted on the Web server) can retrieve data (from databases hosted on the database server). Databases come in many varieties. The kind of database you can use for a Web application depends on the kind of software that’s installed on the database server. Our CarlSites hosting environment runs MYSQL databases. The Programming Language When you install open-source software on your Web account, it’s going to be written in a programming language. Our CarlSites hosting environment has software installed on it that allows it to understand different programming languages. If you install software that’s written in a language that your Web server doesn’t read, it won’t work. The CarlSites hosting environment can currently interpret PHP , PERL , and PYTHON . Add it Together: LAMP If you take a look at all the descriptions above, you can determine that we are running what is known as a LAMP server for sites.carleton.edu: L inux (operating system) A pache (Web server) M ySQL (database server) P HP/PERL/PYTHON (programming language) Applications that are written for LAMP environments will, presumably, run on the server. However , some applications do require additional extensions or libraries that aren’t included in a LAMP environment by default. The applications you can install via Installatron (in cPanel) should work just fine. LAMP environments are unique because all components are open-source, meaning Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP, PERL, and PYTHON are open for anyone to use for free. Anyone can also modify them and redistribute them. As a result, there are lots of online resources for using these systems that have been built by their communities of users. But, also as a result, since you’re not paying for these systems, you can’t just call up a company and ask them to fix a problem. 3. Managing Permissions The default Mediawiki installed has been customized to make it a bit harder for spammers to overwhelm wikis with illegitimate content and comments. This is done by modifying the LocalSettings.php file (a file that is included in every install in which it is possible to provide configurations details). By default, Mediawiki allows anonymous users to create pages and edit pages in the wiki. The modifications change this in the following ways: Anonymous users cannot edit existing pages Anonymous users cannot create pages Registered users must click the confirmation link in the registration email in order to edit or create pages This approach should drastically reduce unsolicited content and comments on Mediawiki installations. One further step that administrator might take is to turn registration off after a predetermined amount of time. Users must create accounts by this date; after that, the settings are changed so that registrations are no longer open. To add this setting, you must edit LocalSettings.php in your Mediawiki install: Login to cPanel and browse to your File Manager . In the File Manager, browse to the folder within public_html that contains your Mediawiki install. If you installed the wiki at the root of your domain, you won’t need to go any further than public_html. If you installed the wiki in a subdomain or subdirectory, you’ll need to find the directory that is associated with that space. Locate LocalSettings.php. Once selecting the file, click download in the top menu bar to download the file as a backup before proceeding. Then click Edit in the top menu bar to edit the file. Confirm that you want to edit the file. Browse to the bottom of the document, and locate the custom settings that were added during the Mediawiki install and the following line: $wgGroupPermissions['*']['createaccount'] = false; 4. Domain Management Domain management refers to the ongoing tasks of keeping a domain (or domains) stable, secure, and able to support related websites. 4.1 What is DNS? Remember back before everyone had computers that fit in their pocket, how companies would ship a book full of phone numbers to your doorstep? We might have known who we were looking for, but we needed to look up phone numbers unless they were your crazy relatives that you learned to memorize. When you get your own domain name, by default it’s nothing more than a shortcut, an address, or (to fit this very imperfect analogy) a phone number. When you type a domain name into the address bar of your browser, someone has to identify it and tell it what to display. That’s where a name server comes in. A name server is a computer, running as a server, that keeps a record of all the domain names that are associated with it and keeps track of where those domains should go. In the case of sites.carleton.edu, the nameserver is the same computer that runs the hosting. You can peek under the hood and see this in action by going to the Websites and Domains tab of your cPanel account and clicking on DNS Settings . DNS stands for Domain Name System and the name server on sites.carleton.edu gives control to it to identify what should be displayed when someone types in your domain. Consider the fact that you might have one or more subdomains in your account. The name server and DNS are able to identify those subdomains and let the world wide web know that they exist and point to some files/folders on a computer somewhere. When you signed up for a domain through the sites.carleton.edu system your nameservers were chosen for you. So when people type in your address, the server responds with information about your account. When you migrate an account away from one hosting platform like sites.carleton.edu and onto a new service, it will require you to change the nameservers so that your domain name points to a new server with its own files and structure. It’s also possible to have subdomains that point to entirely different servers than sites.carleton.edu. 4.2 What is Domain Mapping? Domain mapping, simply put, is deciding where visitors should be directed when they visit various pieces of your website. Domains and subdomains can be mapped directly to folders located within your webhosting account, where you may have installed WordPress, Omeka, MediaWiki, or other web applications. Domains and subdomains can also be mapped to some third-party providers. 4.3 Export your domain To export your domain, we will create a backup of both the files in your domain and the databases that your domain draws from.  First, click on the ‘Manage Your Account’ menu at the top of your screen and select ‘Migration Information. To get started you’ll need to login to your cPanel ( https://sites.carleton.edu/dashboard ) using your Carleton credentials. Once you’re logged in, you’ll see the cPanel interface.  Now click on the Manage Your Account menu at the top of your screen and select Migration Information . To create a backup of your files and databases, simply click the button labeled Add Backup . The system will take a moment to create a backup. When it is complete, you will see the new backup appear below the button. You can click on this backup to download the file. Questions?

CarlSites: cPanel Theme Change,https://stolafcarleton.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2092/Carleton/KB/ArticleDet?ID=141306,"Contents Introduction How to Switch Your Theme The Changes How to Access/Install Sites Resources Introduction If you own a cPanel (site collection), we recommend you change your theme from Paper Lantern (1st image below) to Jupiter (2nd image below) as soon as possible. The Paper Lantern theme will no longer be supported by our hosting server, meaning any future bugs that arise from this theme will not be fixed. Fortunately, the switch to a new theme is relatively seamless with minor changes. How to Switch Your Theme Log into sites.carleton.edu using your Carleton credentials Under the General Information section (menu bar right hand side) Look for Theme Click on the drop down menu Click on Jupiter When you switch your theme to Jupiter for the first time, a pop-up message will appear introducing the new Jupiter theme. If you do not see this message or would like more information, click here . The Changes Besides the obvious appearance of the cPanel, there are a couple other changes to make note of. Different options in the left menu bar The Tools menu option in Jupiter works the same way as the Home menu option in Paper Lantern - both are where all cPanel tools are located in.

Your Sites and the Great Password Change,https://stolafcarleton.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2092/Carleton/KB/ArticleDet?ID=141359,"Introduction If you manage a WordPress or Omeka site, or own a site collection (cPanel) through Carleton, you might be wondering how your new password affects the way you log into these sites. Below, is a list of different situations and what to do for each: Logging into your cPanel If you want to access your cPanel: Go to sites.carleton.edu Click the Log In option on the screen Type in your Carleton credentials (this includes the new password you created for your Carleton account) Sites.carleton.edu uses Single-Sign-On (SSO) so you enter the same password you use everywhere else at Carleton. Logging in directly to your Websites If you want to log in directly into your website, such as Wordpress or Omeka, you will continue to use the same password you used before (most likely different from the password you use anywhere else at Carleton). Because these sites are installed in a separate domain, they do not use Single-Sign-On. Therefore, when you change your Carleton password, it will not affect the login credentials of your website(s). If you need help remembering your credentials and/or need to reset your password, please submit a ticket here . Questions? If you have any questions regarding the information above, please email us at@carleton.edu . Acknowledgement Created by Em Palencia, 2/11/22"
CarlSites: Understanding the cPanel,https://stolafcarleton.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2092/Carleton/KB/ArticleDet?ID=151360,"The cPanel , or control panel , is your dashboard in CarlSites that lets you easily access and manage the files and applications of your account. Once logging into your account, you can see your active domains and personal account information at a glance. Applications CarlSites has four featured applications listed, but there are many, many more that can be utilized. Just click on All Applications in order to see what possibilities lie in wait for your domain! Domains The Domains section of cPanel allows you to manage your addon domains, subdomains, aliases, and redirected domains. Additionally, you can use the Zone Editor to map different parts of your domain to other hosting environments. Subdomains act as a second website with its own unique content without having to register a new domain name. In general, you use your existing domain name and change the www to another relevant term. For example, student.sites.carleton.edu is a subdomain of sites.carleton.edu. Redirects map old domains to your existing domain. Aliases allow you to create additional domain names to be mapped to the current domain. Zone Editor handles DNS (Domain Name System) and allows you to see what’s happening behind the scenes when someone visits your website. For more information, see the “ What is DNS? ” section of this documentation. Files Within files, you are able to manage and organize all the files on your domain. To truly see the capabilities of these tools – just click and explore! File Manager allows you to manage all files connected to your account, including renaming, uploading, and deleting them. You can also get to your file manager using the Quick Links section at the top left of your cPanel. Images lets your manage images that have been previously saved to your account. Directory Privacy allows you to set a password to protect certain directories of your account. Disk Usage helps you monitor your account’s available space. File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a fast and convenient way to transfer large files online. More information can be found in the “ Setting up FTP ” section of this documentation. R1Soft Restore Backups is the recommended backup option of the three backup icons displayed. You can read more about it under the “Automated Offsite Backups” section of Reclaim’s blog post “Backups Done Right” . Databases The Databases section allows you to create MySQL and PostgreSQL databases and users, and to modify and access to them. SQL stands for Structured Query Language . SQL is an international standard in querying and retrieving information from databases. PostgreSQL is an object-relational database management system. phpMyAdmin : manages a single database as well as a whole MySQL server. MySQL Database & MySQL Database Wizard : allows you to store and manage large amounts of information over the web; these are essential to running web-based applications, for example: bulletin boards, content management systems, and online shopping carts. The Wizard guides you through the setup of a MySQL database and user privileges. Remote MySQL : You can use this to add a specific domain name so visitors can connect to your MySQL databases. Metrics cPanel offers a number of different monitoring and statistic tools to help you administer your hosting account. Some of the more important and useful functions are explained in more depth below. Visitors : Use this to see your 1,000 most recent visitors for each of your domains. Errors : This displays the last 300 errors on your site; helpful if looking for missing files or broken links. Bandwidth : Bandwidth represents the amount of information that your server transfers and receives. Use this function to view the bandwidth usage for your site; see total usage, or by month. Includes web and mail usage. Raw Access : This is another stats function that allows you to see who has visited your website without graphics. A downloadable zip file of your site’s activity is availble. Awstats : Allows you to see your website visitors with visual aides. CPU and Concurrent Connection Usage: Lets you visualize the CPU and RAM usage of your site. Security cPanel has an entire security section devoted to protecting different parts of customer web sites from the unauthorized access of their viewers. The cPanel Security section includes SSH Access, IP Blocker, SSL/TLS, Hotlink Protection, Leech Protection and ModSecurity. SSH Access : Allows secure file transfers and remote logins online. Watch a video on how to manage SSH Keys on Reclaim Hosting . IP Blocker : This function allows you to block a range of IP addresses to prevent them from accessing your website. This is done by simply searching a qualified domain name. SSL/TLS : The SSL/TLS Manager will allow you to generate SSL certificates, certificate signing requests, and private keys. These are all parts of using SSL to secure your website. Information is sent encrypted instead of in plain text. Hotlink Protection : Prevents other websites from directly linking to files on your website. Leech Protection : Prevents your users from giving out or publicly posting their passwords to a restricted area of your site ModSecurity : Protects your website from various attacks using a web application firewall, provides additional tools to monitor your Apache web server. SSL/TLS Status: Allows you to view, upgrade, or renew your Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates. Software The Software section of cPanel is located towards the bottom of your cPanel dashboard. The functions that get used most often in this category are Optimize Website and the Installatron Applications Installer . Optimize Website : This function allows you to optimize the performance of your website by tweaking the way Apache handles requests Installatron Applications Installer : Another route to the “View More” in Web Applications, which lists all available features that can be installed on your domain. Advanced The Advanced Section is located at near the very end of your cPanel dashboard. We recommend using this area only if you are familiar and comfortable with utilizing these features. Track DNS : this allows you to find out information about any domain; trace the route from the server to your computer, for example. This can be helpful to make sure your DNS is set up properly. Indexes : This manager customizes the way a directory can be seen (or not seen) online. Error Pages : In two simple steps, you can select the domain you wish to work with, and then create/edit error pages for that site that viewers will see. Virus Scanner : is essentially what it sounds like; start a new virus scan in Mail, Entire Home Directory, Public Web Space or Public FTP space. Preferences The Preferences area allows you to change your language, change the style of the interface, and your contact information. While we recommend that you leave your primary contact email as your school email address, you are more than welcome to add a second! Further, within Contact Information, you can update your notification preferences. Password & Security : allows you to change your cPanel password. (Needed for FTP connection, for example) Change Language : This tool allows you to change the language used in your cPanel Dashboard. Change Style : Use this tool to customize your cPanel interface; choose between Basic and Retrothemes. 1.1 Understanding Accounts & Passwords One aspect of sites.carleton.edu that users may find a bit complicated at first is understanding the different accounts (and associated passwords) that you can manage as part of your participation in the project. This article outlines the types of accounts that you are likely to have, what they are for, and how you go about resetting passwords on each of them. Your cPanel Account When you first sign-up for your domain and hosting, a cPanel account will be generated that provides you with access to your slice of CarlSites. Your cPanel account is automatically associated with your Carleton credentials, so just log into sites.carleton.edu just like you would Moodle or The Hub. Your Application Administrator Accounts Every time you install a new application in cPanel, an Administrator Account for that application will be created. You will likely use these accounts very often – every time you need to login to your application to manage the associated website, you will use this account. For example, if you install WordPress to manage your Web site, every time you need to add content to WordPress, change your theme, approve comments, etc. you will use this account to login. Usually, you will be given the opportunity to choose the username and password for that account. We recommend choosing something that you are likely to remember but that is strong and secure. Upon installation, you will likely receive an email confirming the user-id/password combination you chose. It will also have information about how to access the login page for that application. You may wish to make sure you don’t delete this message. Depending on the application you’re working with, managing and resetting the password for this account will vary. If you’ve used Installatron (in cPanel) to install the application, however, you can always review the account credentials: Login to cPanel through https://sites.carleton.edu/dashboard/ Click the Installatron icon in the Software/Services section. Find the application you installed under My Applications . Click the Edit button. Scroll down to find the Administrator Username and Password. In addition, most applications should have some kind of password reset link on the login page. Other Types of Accounts In addition to the account types outlined above, there are a few other kinds of accounts you may have as part of sites.carleton.edu When you sign up for subdomain/top-level domain on sites.carleton.edu, cPanel will automatically create an FTP account for you by default. You’ll also have the option of manually creating your own FTP account. You can learn about their differences here . Application User Accounts: In addition to the Administrator Account that you set up when installing an application, most applications will also let you set up user profile accounts within each application. 1.2 File Structures and the File Manager Web hosting is, at its basic core, files and folders on a computer that is connected to the internet and setup to distribute them. How that computer (typically a server) is set up to do that is covered more in LAMP Environments but this article will explain the idea of the file structure and how it relates to what you view on your domain. When you signed up for your domain, a web hosting account was created. Although you typically will interact mostly with the web interface to create subdomains, install applications, and other common tasks, you might occasionally also need to work directly with the files in your account. The File Manager in your cPanel is one way to see these files. You can also create an FTP account in cPanel and use an FTP program to interact with these files FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol, and it’s a way of using a desktop client to transfer files to and from your Web server space). Let’s take a look at the File Manager built into your cPanel to get a better understanding of the file structure that makes up your website(s). Login to sites.carleton.edu with your Carleton credentials On the homepage of your cPanel, you’ll have all the various tools listed. You can also find its icon under Files . You can also easily find the File Manager by using the search tool in the upper righthand corner. You are now sent to the File Manager and can navigate the folder structure there. You’ll notice when the File Manager opens up that this looks very much like a folder on your computer. There are a few folders in it as well as files, and you can navigate down into those folders and see what’s inside of them. At the top level of the File Manager, you also have the option of interacting with files and folders you select by moving them around or removing them. There is a larger article all about how to use the file manager at Accessing Your Files through the File Manager so we won’t talk much about how the interface works here. Instead, we’ll cover what those folders and files actually mean and how they relate to what someone sees when they visit your website. By default, you have a variety of folders at the root of your web space (the first screen you see when you open up the file manager). Some of them are created automatically to store information about the panel and setup of certain sites. These folders are things like access-logs, etc, ssl, and tmp. You can safely ignore most of those folders because they don’t correspond to actual websites. Let’s look at which folders do and how it all works. Your main domain will correspond with a folder called public_html . Whatever files and folders are inside of this folder are available on that main domain. If you installed WordPress here you’ll likely see a lot of WordPress-related files within it (which were probably helpfully put there by the automated installer). Let’s say we uploaded an image called mypicture.jpg directly into the public_html folder. That image would now be available at yourdomain.com/mypicture.jpg. The slash after your domain implies “this file is inside this folder”. But what if we had a folder inside the public_html folder? How does that appear? This is typically called a subfolder so let’s put a folder in public_html called “images” and put our image, mypicture.jpg, inside of that folder. What would you type in a browser to get to that file now? The location would be mydomain.com/images/mypicture.jpg. So subfolders are also indicated by a forward slash after a domain. What about subdomains? You can have completely separate sites called subdomains that appear as nameofsubdomain.yourdomain.com. But where are they in the file structure? When you create a subdomain, cPanel will ask you to give the subdomain directory a name. If I had a subdomain called photos.mydomain.com for example, I might want to name the folder “photos” (by default your cPanel will call the folder by the name of the subdomain). Folders for subdomains are located inside the public_html folder. So when you go to the File Manager and navigate to public _ html, you’ll see folders listed for all of your subdomains and once you navigate inside one of those folders, you’ll see files and folders specifically for that subdomain that appear on the web at that subdomain’s address. File Manager in cPanel is great to view these files and folders, but it can be limiting if you want to upload an entire folder of information to your website. If you find yourself wanting to do more with the files and folders on your web space you may want to consider using File Transfer Protocol (FTP). FTP will allow you to upload and download files to and from your File Manager (i.e. your website) in bulk. For information on using FTP, click here . 1.3 Accessing Your Files through the File Manager Your CarlSites cPanel includes a File Manager that allows you to interact directly with the files stored in your web hosting account. This can be useful if you want to upload software that cannot be automatically installed via the Web Applications section of your cPanel, if you need to change the name or permissions of a file or group or files, or if you want to edit a plain text file. To access your files via the File Manager, use these steps: Login to sites.carleton.edu with your Carleton credentials. Once logged in, you’ll be on the homepage of your cPanel. The easiest way to navigate your cPanel is by utilizing the search bar in the top right panel. Search File Manager . When you press enter, you will be automatically redirected to the File Manager.  You can also find the File Manager icon under the Files section. On the left side of the “File Manager” window, you’ll see a navigation menu containing the file structure of your web hosting account. More information about the contents of these files and folders can be found in the File Structures and the File Manager documentation article. In the navigation menu, choose the public_html directory. This will take you directly to the folder that contains the files associated with your website(s). You’ll notice your current location (the public_html folder) is bolded and highlighted in this menu. Click the [+] (expand) icon next to a folder to see what subfolders it contains, or click on the name of the folder to view all of its contents in the file browser on the right side of the page. You can also navigate through the folders in your account by double-clicking on them in the menu on the left side of your file manager. To select an item, click once on its icon in the file browser. You can also use the “Select All” button above the file browser, or your computer’s keyboard shortcuts (Shift, Command, Control, etc), to select multiple items from this list. Depending on what you have selected, different options will be available to you in the action menu across the top of your file manager. For example, if you have selected a folder, you can rename it or Change Permissions on it. If you know exactly what location you want to skip to within your web hosting account, you can type it into the box directly above the navigation menu and click Go . Alternatively, if you know the exact name of the file or folder you are looking for, but not its location, you can use the Search box to find it. 1.4 Subdomains vs. Subdirectories When you’re first getting started with a new space on a new Web host, you might think of yourself as owning a small “territory” of the Web. Everything you place in your public folder on the server becomes available for anyone on the Web to see (assuming they know the address of your site and the files you’ve placed there). If you’re just putting up a handful of static, HTML pages which you want to make available to colleagues, friends, or family by sending them links, then working with this large, unorganized space may work. But as soon as you get to the point where you want to organize your site, you’re going to need a new strategy. Consider this scenario: you want to have a personal blog on your new Web space, where you share pictures and short written pieces with family, friends, and colleagues. In addition, you’re working on a large research project that requires you to build a Web-based repository of digital images related to your discipline. You want to use one application (say, WordPress ) to manage your personal blog. For your research project, you’ve settled on another open-source application (Say, Omeka ). Both of these are applications that need to be installed on your Web host, but you can’t just put them both at your main domain name – if you did, both sites would quickly experience conflicts and errors. You need to cordon off separate spaces for your different Web “properties.” There are two primary strategies for parceling up your Web space. You can create subdomains or subdirectories . But before you can understand the difference, you need to first understand what we mean when we talk about your root domain. Root Domain Let’s say you’ve registered a new domain for sites.carleton.edu called blog.sites.carleton.edu. Anything that is stored at this core URL is considered to be at the root of your domain. Nothing comes before the address or after the address. You can certainly decide that you simply want to have a single site on your Web host (say a blog running WordPress), and you can set that blog up at your domain’s root. To get to your site in this scenario, users would simply go to blog.sites.carleton.edu. Subdomains When you want to do more than just have a single site at the root of your site, you need to decide now to organize your space. One way to do so is by setting up subdomains . You’re may already be familiar with the concept of subdomains, even if you don’t know it. Consider Google’s website at https://google.com. As you browse features of that site, you’ll notice that the domain changes. When you’re looking at your Gmail account, for example, the domain changes to https://mail.google.com. Now the root of the url is mail.google.com, indicating that you’re on the part of the site that is dedicated to Google’s mail services. In this instance, mail.google.com is a subdomain that provides a different utility than google.com. The domains serve two purposes: they help to organize the site from a technical perspective, but they also serve as indications to the users that they are in a new/different space. As you work on your site, you’re welcome to create as many subdomains as you like, and in each subdomain you can actually create a distinct, individual Web site. Subdirectories The alternative for organizing your space is to simply set up subdirectories. These function much like file folders on your computer. Instead of creating a blog at blog.yourdomain.com you would place it in a subdirectory called “blog” making the address yourdomain.com/blog . Setting up subdirectory is really easy. You can create folders on the fly when installing applications (like WordPress), and you can also manually create them in your file browser. There is one particular issue you need to be aware of: Let’s say you’ve installed WordPress to be your primary blog at yourdomain.com . Later, you decide you want to install WordPress again for a separate image gallery site, and you want to place it at yourdomain.com/gallery . But, if for some reason you’ve already created a page on your WordPress site called “Gallery” then the url yourdomain.com/gallery will already be taken. If you try to create a subdirectory of the same name, you’ll get a conflict and errors. Tips & Review Subdomains are generally a cleaner, more elegant solution to organizing your site. You’re less likely to get conflicts or errors. However, when using subdomains the process is slightly more complicated: You must create subdomains first before you can install anything in the. Subdirectories don’t create as pretty URLs as subdomains, but they’re easier to set up. They can, however, result in conflicts with existing Web pages. As soon as you create subdomains or subdirectories to organize your site, you need to consider how people are going to find them. If you’ve created a new primary blog at blog.yourdomain.com , and someone goes to just yourdomain.com , they won’t see that new site. It is possible to set up redirects to avoid this issue. You can also always create links from pages on one subdomain of your site to another. If you really just need one site, sometimes installing at the root of your domain is the easiest thing to do, at least as you’re getting started. You can always add more pieces to your territory later with either subdomains or subdirectories. 1.5 Setting Up Subdomains A subdomain is one way of organizing and separating content on your site. To create a subdomain, use the following steps: Log into sites.carleton.edu with your Carleton credentials to access your cPanel. Once logged in, you’ll be at the homepage of your cPanel. The easiest way to navigate your cPanel is using the search feature in the top right panel. Click the Search box and type “subdomains” (without the quotes). When you press enter, you will automatically be taken to the Subdomains page. Or, you can scroll down and click the Subdomains icon under the Domains section of cPanel. Choose a name for your subdomain and type it into the Subdomain box. Just like top-level domains, subdomains can only contain numbers, letters, and hyphens, and the best subdomains are simple, short, and descriptive. Once you’ve typed in a name, cPanel will automatically populate the Document root field for you. This will create a folder to contain your subdomain’s files. You’ll usually want this folder to match the name of your subdomain, so it’s easy to identify where different files live in your account. You might want to change the document root if you already have a folder in your account that has the same name as the subdomain you are trying to create, although this should be rare. Once you’re done, click Create . Once you’re done, click Create. If everything went well, you should see a message that your subdomain was created successfully. Your subdomain will now be available as an option for automatic installation of various software (WordPress, MediaWiki, etc). If you prefer to install web applications manually, you can do so in the document root (folder) you created in step 5. 1.6 Applications Available in Installatron Installatron, the script installer that is part of the CarlSites cPanel, allows you to easily install Web applications to your Web space.  Login to your Dashboard, and under Applications > All Applications , you will see all the available applications. 1.7 Installing Applications with Installatron Installatron is a script installer that allows you to quickly and easily install Web applications to on the Web space. By default, when you use Installatron, the application you add will be automatically upgraded whenever a new version is available (and a backup will be kept, just in case). Installing Applications Using Installatron To get started you’ll need to login to your cPanel by going to https://sites.carleton.edu/dashboard/ . Here you’ll log in with your Carleton credentials. Once logged in you’ll be on the homepage of your cPanel. You will need to scroll down until you see a section of your cPanel labeled Web Applications . Within this section, you will see a link to the Installatron which you should click. Or, you can type “installatron” (without quotes) into the search bar.  When you press enter you will automatically be redirected to the Installatron page. A listing of all of the applications you can install by default in Installatron will appear. Navigate to the one you want to install, and click the icon. After clicking the icon, a page will appear with information about the application, links to resources, and a link to install it. Click Install this application when you are ready. A page will appear with a number of settings you can choose/change. The image below shows these settings; here is a rundown of them: Location : You’ll need to choose where to install your new application. You can install it at the root of your domain or in a subdomain (which you need to set up first). In addition, you can place your application in a folder (in either your root domain or a subdomain) Version Information : You can choose a version of the application. Generally, we recommend choosing the default version. It is likely to be the most recent, stable release. Updates & Database Management : By default, the system is set up to automatically upgrade (and create backups upon upgrading) all applications. In addition, by default, the database will be set up for you automatically. We recommend NOT changing these options . Username/Password : An username/password will be automatically generated for you. You can choose to change this if you like. Click Install : After installation, you’ll be taken back to the main Installatron page, with details about the application you just installed. At any time you can come back here to review the application details, back it up manually, or uninstall it. To get to your new site, you can click the “website” link. What’s more, with certain applications you can use this space to log in to the admin area. In addition, you’ll have received an email with your username/password and a link to your new site. 1.8 Managing Backups Any application that you install in CarlSites using the cPanel/Installatron is set to automatically create a backup of the whole app every time the software updates. The backups expire after 14 days, but they can quickly eat up quota space in that time, especially since some apps (such as WordPress) update automatically. Follow the steps in each section below to take more control over the space that backups use in your account. 1. Turn off the automatic Installatron backup Go to your cPanel Go to Applications > WordPress > My Applications . From there, select the wrench next to your site’s name. Scroll down to Automatic Update Backup and set that to Do not create a backup 2. View restore points in R1Soft Backups App The R1Soft Restore Backups app can be found in the “Files” section of your cPanel dashboard. This app should already be active so there are no additional steps you need to take to set it up. R1Soft automatically creates an off-site backup of your files and databases nightly. You can open the app from your cPanel to verify that there are restore points listed. More information about how this app works can be found in this documentation from our hosting provider, Reclaim Hosting, under the “Automated Offsite Backup” heading: https://reclaimhosting.com/backups-done-right/ . 3. Create a manual Installatron backup before major changes While R1Soft creates daily backups of all of your content, it’s best practice to have a backup of your application from right before you start tinkering, just in case anything goes wrong. That way you won’t lose any content that’s been added or changed since the latest daily backup. As a bonus, backups created through the Installatron are easy to restore with a single click. These manual backups can even be sent to an offsite location like Dropbox to save space. To create a manual backup: From your cPanel, click My Apps in the Applications section. Click the checkbox to the far right of the application name (labeled 1 in the screenshot below). Click “Backup” below the bottom of the application list (labeled 2 in the screenshot below). On the next screen, enter a descriptive label and click Backup again. The backup will run with a status bar.​ Questions? Use the Report Issue button in this article.

The The Exhibit Builder plugin (which is already installed in CarlSites Omeka Template ) allows you to develop online exhibits, or special web pages, that combine items from your Omeka site and may include narrative text. Continue reading to learn how to add and customize an exhibit to your Omeka website. Note: You need Items in your Omeka site before building exhibit. Getting Started Add an Exhibit Select the Exhibits menu item on the left-hand sidebar Click the Add an Exhibit button Enter Exhibit level Metadata Metadata includes Title, Slug, Credits, Description, Tags, Theme, Summary Page, and Cover Image (all of which are optional). The Slug is what the URL will be. If left blank, the system will automatically generate one based on the title. Best practice is to create specific titles to avoid confusing pages across multiple exhibits. Add Content Page(s) Once you have created an Exhibit you can add Pages to it by clicking the Add Page button at the bottom of the Exhibit Metadata page On the new page, you’ll need to enter another Title (optional slug). To save the page information and continue editing that page, click the Save Changes button. To save the basic information for that page and add another page, click the Save and Add Another Page button. 1. Add Content Blocks, Text, and Items In Omeka exhibits, “content blocks” are where you put your information, such as text and images. There are four basic kinds of blocks: item(s) with text, an item gallery, text only, and file only . Each page can have one or more content blocks. Select a New Block type and click Add new content block Add items and text in the respective places Repeat these steps to add new content blocks to the same page Or repeat the steps earlier in this section to create multiple pages. 2. Organize Pages - Exhibit Navigation When you have multiple pages, you can reorder them by dragging and dropping the Page Titles on the main page of your exhibit. You can also make Subpages by dragging a page directly underneath another page and moving it slightly right. Need Help? Use the Request Service button at the top right of this article.

CarlSites: Omeka Setup Guide,https://stolafcarleton.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2092/Carleton/KB/ArticleDet?ID=154371,"In order to upload images, install themes and plugins, and make them work properly, some setup is required after installing Omeka Classic. Below are some areas you will need to set up to get your site up and running. ImageMagick Omeka requires the ImageMagick library in order to resize and generate thumbnails for your images. The setting for this is located under the Settings > General tab and the path to ImageMagick is /usr/bin Uploading Plugins and Themes Omeka provides a variety of open source themes and plugins on their website available for download. However there is no automated process for loading them into your Omeka installation from the admin interface at this time. Here’s how to makes plugins and themes available to your installation. In cPanel you’ll be using the File Manager utility to navigate to the appropriate folder and upload the files. You’ll find a plugins and a themes folder. Inside of those folders are the plugins and themes for your installation. Adding a new one is as easy as uploading a zipped file and extracting it using the built-in tools of the File Manager. You can find a more detailed guide of this process here . Fixing Background PHP Path Some plugins for Omeka a, such as the CSV Import, Neatline and OHMS Import will require that you explicitly specify the background PHP path in order to work properly, as these plugins require PHP-CLI. Start by checking the MultiPHP Manager in your cPanel. In the PHP Version column, you’ll see something along the lines of PHP 8.1 (ea-php81) , which means you are using PHP 8.1 . This is the PHP version you’ll need to specify as the background.php path in your Omeka config files. The paths for the PHP versions we offer are as follows: PHP 7.3 → /usr/local/bin/ea-php73 PHP 7.4 → /usr/local/bin/ea-php74 PHP 8.0 → /usr/local/bin/ea-php80 PHP 8.1 → /usr/local/bin/ea-php81 In the File Manager ​​​​​​​, find the setting named background.php.path and you’ll find it in: $OMEKA_ROOT /application/config/config.ini Questions? f you have any questions or run into any issues, please use the Report Issue button (located at the top-right) and select Academic website request (CarlSites) under Website Request Type Acknowledgement Created by Em Palencia, 9/19/2023"

Moodle: Course Settings,https://stolafcarleton.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2092/Carleton/KB/ArticleDet?ID=134591,"A teacher, or other users with the update course settings permission, can enter the Course settings menu by clicking on Edit Settings . On Fordson ( Do not force) , this is via the buttons Course Management section (the icon in the top-left). On Moove and Carleton Boost, this is via the Actions menu (the icon in the top-right). Table of content General Description Course format Appearance Files and uploads Completion tracking Groups General Course full name - This is the name of the course. It is displayed as a link on course lists on the Dashboard and in reports. Short name - This field contains the discipline, course number, section, and term.  It is not editable by Teachers because it is used to automatically enroll students. Course category - This setting is used to organize the course catalog and is also not editable by teachers. Course start date - This should be set to the Sunday prior to the start of classes. This along with the Course End Date control when a course appears in the ""Current Courses"" section of the Course Overview block on the Moodle Dashboard. Course end date - An end date may be specified, although this does not affect students' access to the course. Course visibility - Here you can ""hide"" your course completely. It will not appear in the list of courses, except for managers, course creators, teachers and any other users with the view hidden courses capability. Even if students try to access the course URL directly, they will not be allowed to enter. Course ID number - This is also used to ensure students and instructors get enrolled in the appropriate courses.  It is also not editable by teachers. Description Course Summary - The summary appears on the course listings page and appears in the Course/Site description block. Course summary files - An image may be attached to the course summary. They will be accessible by anyone from outside of the course just like the course name and/or summary. This image will also display in the graphic part of the course tile when looking at the Course Overview block on the Moodle Dashboard. Course format Format - Choose from a number of interesting formats . Hidden sections - This option allows you to decide how the hidden sections in your course are displayed to students. By default, a small area is shown (in collapsed form, usually grey) to indicate where the hidden section is, though they still cannot actually see the hidden activities and texts. This is particularly useful in the Weekly format, so that non-class weeks are clear, or if you have quizzes you don't want your students to see. ( TIP: If you choose, these non-available items can be completely hidden, so that students do not even know that sections or an activity in the course are hidden.) Course layout The Course layout setting determines whether the whole course is displayed on one page or split over several pages. The setting currently applies to the topics and weekly core course formats and contributed collapsed topics course format only. Teachers choose from the drop-down whether they wish to ""show all sections on one page"" in the familiar scrolling format, or ""show one section per page"". If one section per page is selected, the course page is abbreviated to a list of links to individual sections. If an individual section is shown, the next and previous sections may be accessed via links above and below the section. Appearance Force theme - You may change the overall theme of the course page . Force language - If you force a language in a course, the interface of Moodle in this course will be in this particular language, even if a student has selected a different preferred language in their personal profile. Number of announcements - How many news items should show the Latest announcements block. Set it to 0 and ""Latest news"" block will not appear. The Latest News block relies on the use of the announcement forum. News posted in other forums do not display in the latest News block Show gradebook to students - Here, you can decide if students have access to the gradebook. If your course doesn't use graded activities, it makes sense to disable this option. If grades are used and this link is disabled, students can still see their grades in the activity itself, such as an assignment. Show activity reports - Here you can decide whether to show students their activity reports. Doing so places a load on the server, which is why the setting is disabled by default. Files and uploads Here you can decide the largest size of file that students can upload to a course. The site administrator will determine sizes available for the teacher to select. Completion tracking Completion tracking must be enabled for Activity completion. Course completion criteria may also be based upon Activity completion values found in the activity's settings. Groups Group mode - Here you can define the group mode at the course level by a pull-down menu. ""No groups"", ""Separate groups"" and ""Visible groups"" are the choices. The selected setting will be the default group mode for all activities defined within that course. The group setting can affect what users see in the participants list and who they can interact with in different activities. Force - If the group mode is ""forced"" at a course level, then this particular group mode will be applied to every activity in that course. This will override any activities that may have a special group setting. Default grouping - If groupings are enabled, a default grouping for course activities and resources may be set.

Moodle: Blocks,https://stolafcarleton.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2092/Carleton/KB/ArticleDet?ID=138593,"Blocks are items that may be added to the left or right or center column of any page in Moodle. They may also be added to the center of the Dashboard. Adding a Block To add a block, first enable editing on the main course page. Then, scroll down to the bottom of the navigation bar on the left and click ""Add a Block."" You may need to expand this navigation bar by clicking the 3 horizontal bars icon in the top left. After adding a block, click the edit icon in the block header to configure it. (You may change the permission of the blocks .) Blocks can be placed on the side of the screen (if your theme supports it) via the Move icon . Block Types The most often used block types in Carleton Moodle include: Activities, Carleton Resources, Comments, Completion Progress, Configurable Reports, Course completion status, Course/site summary, Feedback, HTML, Latest announcements, Latest badges, Level up!,  My Courses, Navigation, Upcoming events, etc. There are many more types of blocks available in Carleton Moodle. The functionality of each type of block is usually very straightforward. On a course page, a teacher might, for example, have Course Summary block on the right-hand side for general information such as professor name, office hours, syllabus, etc., followed by a Course Completion block to allow students to see how many activities they have finished, and a Carleton Resources block which contains a list of the available academic resources here at Carleton. Using HTML Blocks HTML blocks are highly flexible as they allow you to display text, images, videos, etc. While editing and HTML block, any text or media you put in the content area will show up in the block.

Moodle: Flexible Sections Course Format,https://stolafcarleton.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2092/Carleton/KB/ArticleDet?ID=135809,"Contents Introduction Configuring Flexible Sections format How it Works Reference Introduction The flexible sections format allows to have nested sections and each section may be displayed expanded (with all content on the parent section page) or collapsed (as a link to a separate page). This course format looks very similar to Topics format except: There is no limit to the number of sections which can be added and removed as necessary Sections can also be added inside other sections Each section (regardless of its nesting level) can be shown expanded or collapsed. Teacher can change it in edit mode. If a section is displayed collapsed, its name is displayed as a link to the separate page and on this separate page the link ""Back to ... "" is displayed If teacher hides a section all nested sections and activities become hidden as well. Please note that if a section has both activities and subsections, activities are displayed first. Configuring Flexible Sections Format Enter the Edit Settings menu to access the Course settings page. On Fordson ( Do not force) , this is via the Course Management section (the icon in the top-left). On Moove and Carleton Boost, this is via the Actions menu (the icon in the top-right). Scroll to and expand the Course Format section. Expand the drop-down menu next to the Format label. Select Flexible Sections . Select one of the Save options at the bottom of the page. How it Works The sections appear in 'boxes' in the course and when editing is turned on, the teacher can add sections within sections. The teacher can decide, for each section or subsection, whether to display all the contents expanded or collapsed: Click on the Edit Section Settings (the ⚙️ icon) in the upper left of the section. Next to the Display content label, choose Show Expanded or Show Contracted. Select one of the Save options at the bottom of the page. 'Collapsed' will display a link to the subsection(s) and the student clicks on one to access its content.  When the student has finished with the content in that subsection, a link at the top of the page takes them back to the original course section. The teacher can make some subsections collapsed and some expanded. Expanded subsections show their title and content in a similar way to using labels to divide up activities in a regular course format. Reference Below is an example of the Flexible sections format.

Introduction The single activity format only has 1 section, and allows the teacher to add one activity only to the course. When the single activity format is selected, a drop down menu appears for the teacher to choose the activity they wish to use. Note: This course format replaces the SCORM format in earlier versions of Moodle, as it is possible here to select a SCORM package as the single activity. Single activity format with a forum as the activity and social format are very similar. The only difference is when the course contains other activities. The single activity format displays them as ""orphaned"" and for teachers only; the social format displays them in an activities block and available for students.

Moodle: Creating custom scales for grading,https://stolafcarleton.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2092/Carleton/KB/ArticleDet?ID=148214,"It is possible to create a custom grading scale that you can use for most of your assignments in Moodle. Creating the scale is not very challenging, although it is important to understand how scales are calculated into the Gradebook. You can use words, numbers, or symbols to indicate your items in your scale, but Moodle will use your values to represent points along a 100 point scale and use the percentage for calculation purposes. Explanation Let's say you want to grade assignments using [No Credit, ✔️➖, ✔️,✔️➕] scale.  This scale has only 4 scale items in it, with 'No Credit' being the lowest and ✔️➕ being the highest.  Moodle will equate No Credit to 0%, ✔️➖ to 33%, ✔️ to 66% and ✔️➕ 100%. Scale item Percentage Value No Credit 0% ✔️➖ 33% ✔️ 66% ✔️➕ 100% However, if you want your ✔️➖ equal 85%, ✔️ equal 90% and the ✔️➕ equal 95%, then you would create your Moodle Scale as shown below. If you don't want to use some of the values, you don't have to have anything in the scale item column, but you do need to have the empty spaces. Scale Item Percentage Value No Credit 0% ➖ 10% ➖ 15% ➖ 20% ➖ 25% ➖ 30% ➖ 35% ➖ 40% ➖ 45% ➖ 50% ➖ 55% ➖ 60% ➖ 65% ➖ 70% ➖ 75% ✔️➖ 80% ✔️➖ 85% ✔️ 90% ✔️➕ 95% ✔️➕ 100% Creating a new Moodle Scale Within the Gradebook Setup, Click on the Scales tab Click the ""Add a New Scale"" button at the bottom of the screen. Give your scale a name (something that will be explanatory to you) Add specifics about your scale in the Description box. Enter your scale items in ASCENDING order with commas between them. Save changes. Example Using the above scale, you would copy/paste the following text into the Scale field of your new Scale. NC,➖,➖,➖,➖,➖,➖,➖,➖,➖,➖,➖,➖,➖,➖,✔️➖,✔️➖,✔️,✔️➕,✔️➕ This would result in your scale looking like this when used in Moodle assignment: File Template The Excel spreadsheet attached to this article contains the percentage values of each scale item based on how many items are in the scale.  Feel free to use it as a template for figuring out how many items you may want in your custom scale.

On Fordson ( Do not force) , this is via the Course Management section (the icon in the top-left). On Moove and Carleton Boost, this is via the Actions menu (the icon in the top-right). Creating grade items Activities that receive grades, such as Assignments, Quizzes, or possibly Forums, automatically create entries into the gradebook, but you can also add additional grade items to include activities that happen outside of Moodle. To add a grade item: At the bottom of the page, click the Add grade item button Fill in the following information Item name Grade type This changes how you will grade the item. Picking ""Value"" sets it to standard point value grading (Ex: score/100) Maximum/Minimum grade Weight By default, grade items are weighted by their maximum grade. However, by checking ""Weight adjusted"", you can change the grade item's weight to be higher or lower. Grade category Click ""Save changes"" at the bottom of the screen Creating grade categories A grade category is useful to help organize similar assignments in the gradebook. For example, you can create a large ""Quiz"" category that holds every quiz given in the course for easy viewing. At the bottom of the page, click the Add Category button Enter a name for your category (e.g. ""Quizzes"") Click ""Save changes"" at the bottom of the screen Moving grade items into categories Check the box in the Select column of any of the grade items you wish to move At the bottom of the screen, pick a category from the ""Move selected items to"" drop-down menu The page will reload and move your grade items into the category you selected Assigning weights to your categories or grade items The gradebook will automatically calculate relative grade weights based on the maximum grade values of each grade item, but you can override those weights and enter your own on either categories or individual grade items. In the Weights column, check the box to the left of any category/grade item weight you would like to override Enter the relative weight out of 100 you wish to assign to that item Repeat this for any other Categories or Grade Items you wish to customize. Weights at each tier of the gradebook should add up to 100. If your weights do not add up to 100, Moodle will adjust the weights so that they do. When all weights are assigned, scroll to the bottom of the list and click the ""Save changes"" button in the lower left. Show gradebook to students The gradebook is not visible to the students by default. If you wish to make it visible to students: Enter the Edit Settings menu to access the Course settings page.

Question Types Description A description is not a question but instead is a space to insert information. In addition to text, you can add a variety of media to these boxes including videos (Panopto, YouTube), images, and audio. Multiple Choice Multiple Choice questions prompt students to pick one or more answers to a question. Important settings: One or multiple answers?: Set whether students can select more than one choice. Answers: Write the text for each choice and assign a grade to each choice Note: The grades for all responses combined must equal 100% True or False True False questions are essentially Multiple Choice questions with two choices: True and False. Important settings: Correct answer: Choose whether the assertion in the question text is true or false Matching Matching questions have students match a set of questions to a set of answers by choosing from a drop down list of responses for each question. Important settings: Answers: Input your question-answer pairs in the Question and Answer boxes. You can add an extra false answer by writing the false answer in the answer box without any question. Essay Essay questions are manually graded and accept typed-out student responses. Important settings: Allow attachments: Choose whether students can add attachments to their text and if so, how many. Grader information: If you have graders in your class, you may include instructions for them in this text box. Numerical Numerical questions are like short answers except that they are math-centered with the ability to account for error and units. Important settings: Answers: Write the answers (numbers only) in the answer boxes and choose appropriate error values. Unit handling: In this section, you can choose whether or not to enable units and how to handle them Unit handling (drop-down menu): ""Units are not used at all..."" : Only the numerical value of the response will be graded. Any unit in the response will be ignored. ""Units are optional..."" : Units included in the response will be converted to a default unit, defined as Unit 1 in the Units section. Responses without units will be assumed to be of unit 1. If this is selected, choose the position of the unit under Units go and set up your units in the Units section. Students will need to type in their units with this option, so you may want to provide a list of acceptable units in the question text. ""The unit must be given..."" : Units must be included in the response, and there is a penalty for using the wrong unit in the response. This option uses the same unit conversion as the previous option. Units: Define which units will be used in the question and their multiplicative relationship with each other Unit 1 is the default unit for the question, and will always have a multiplier of 1. Other units that you add will have multipliers in relation to Unit 1 An example table of units: Unit # Name Multiplier Unit 1 m 1 Unit 2 km .001 Unit 3 mm 1000 Calculated Calculated questions are math questions like numerical questions that allow for variation of the values in the question by drawing from a dataset. Important settings: There are three separate pages when you are creating/editing a Calculated question: Page 1: Creating/Editing a Calculated question Question text: Write out the question while naming and enclosing your variables (AKA wild cards) in curly brackets. Ex: A rectangle has a base of {base} and a height of {height}. What is the perimeter? Answers: Write a formula for the answer including the variables defined in the question. You can use operations such as: +, -, /, * Ex: 2*{base} + 2*{height} Unit/Unit handling: Works the same as in Numerical questions Page 2: Choose wildcards dataset properties This page allows you to use shared datasets within a category and synchronize the values with different quiz questions. To keep it simple for now, leave these settings as default and click ""Next page"". Page 3: Edit the wildcards datasets On this page, you can add to/edit the sets of possible values for your variables. Each grouping of values is called a set . Item to add: This section lists all your variables and lets you change the parameters for each, such as the range of values and the decimal places Add: Add new sets to the question Delete: Remove sets from the question Set #: Your sets will be listed here. You can change the amount of displayed sets with the drop-down menu. If you want to manually edit a set: Type in new values in the boxes of the displayed set Click ""Display"" to save Short Answer Short Answer questions ask for a word or a short phrase as an answer. Important settings: Answers: Write in all acceptable forms of the correct answer as different answers and set the grade to 100% for each. Ex: Question - Name one of the three main rock classifications. Answer 1: Igneous Answer 2: Sedimentary Answer 3: Metamorphic Drag and Drop There are three different types of drag and drop question on Moodle: into text, onto image, and matching. Important settings: Drag and drop Into text questions use a number contained by double brackets - [[1]] - as a placeholder for the correct word in the question text. Choices: Write the correct answer for each placeholder in its own box. Grouped choices appear as color-coded to students and cannot be dropped into different-colored slots. Drag and drop onto image questions have students drag labels/images to associated areas on a background image. Preview: Upload a background image and click ""Refresh preview"" Draggable items: Use either text labels or images as answers to drag onto the image These can be grouped as well Drop zones: Assign each draggable item to a drop zone (excluding incorrect items), then go back to the Preview section and place the drop zones on the image. Drag and drop matching : Refer to Matching questions Quizzes in Panopto For information on quizzes in Panopto, please watch the following videos: How to Add a Quiz to a Video Panopto Quizzes and Moodle Integration Learn more For more information about Moodle quizzes, please visit the Quizzing section of the Moodle Micro-Skill Tutorials course .

Moodle: Quiz - Automatic and Manual Grading,https://stolafcarleton.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2092/Carleton/KB/ArticleDet?ID=141893,"Automatic vs Manual Grading Most quiz questions (multiple choice, true/false, etc.) can be automatically graded , meaning that Moodle will auto-calculate a score for the question. If a quiz has only automatically graded questions, then the total score for the quiz will be available as soon as the student completes their attempt. Manually graded questions, on the other hand, must be evaluated by a grader. For example, essay questions must always be manually graded.

Moodle: Course Sites and Enrollments,https://stolafcarleton.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2092/Carleton/KB/ArticleDet?ID=145873,"Carleton pre-populates courses and enrollments into Moodle so that instructors do not have to do this. Courses You should see your Moodle course sites automatically on the Moodle Dashboard. Moodle course sites start out hidden from students, but not from instructors. If you are having trouble finding the course you think you should see, please contact Academic Technologies and we will help you out. Multiple Sections If you are teaching two sections of the same course, we automatically create a third course site and link the enrollments for each section. As an example, if you are teaching two sections of Japanese 101 in Moodle you will see three course sites: japn101-01-f22, japn101-02-f22 and japn101-f22 (Instructor Last Name). The last course that includes your name is intended for you to use as a joint site for both sections of your course. The enrollments from sections 1 and 2 are linked to that course and you automatically have groups created on that site for each section.  That is handy for when you want to send an announcement or make an assignment to only one section. The best part of the enrollment sync is that it is kept up to date as students add or drop your course! Enrolling TAs, Graders, Writing Assistants, R&I Librarians, etc. We do not automatically add any other people other than those enrolled in or teaching a course. If you would like to add others to your course site, you can do so by going to the Participants list for your course.  Be sure to also have a look at our guide on Roles and Permissions to learn about how to add people to your course and the different roles you can give them.

Moodle: Linking to a Metacourse,https://stolafcarleton.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2092/Carleton/KB/ArticleDet?ID=148578,"Overview Linking courses to a metacourse in Moodle allows for automatic enrollment into the metacourse from one or more subcourses. Metacourses are most often used to organize classes with multiple sections. Groups are automatically created based on sub-sections. Linking a sub-course to a metacourse ⚠️ You can link sub courses into a metacourse only if you are listed as an instructor in the subcourse. If you are not listed, you can request the instructor to manually add you with the Teacher role ( here's how ) or use the Request Service button on the upper right of this page In the top left corner of your metacourse's course page, click the Course Management button to access the Course Dashboard Under the Course Settings column, select Course administration Click the Users tab at the top of the screen and then click on the Enrolment methods heading Click the Add method drop-down menu and select Course meta link To select a course to link, either search for it by name in the search box or use the drop-down arrow to view a list of possible courses Note: If you can't find the course you want to link, check to see if you are an instructor in that course If you want to enroll students from the subcourse into groups, click the Add to group menu and select Create new group to auto-create a group for the subcourse Click the blue Add method button at the bottom of the screen Questions?

Moodle: Enrollments,https://stolafcarleton.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2092/Carleton/KB/ArticleDet?ID=138955,"Table of Content Automatic enrollment Self-enrollment Manual enrollment Adding students in bulk Allowing guests into a course Adding non-Carleton email participants Linked courses Automatic enrollment At Carleton, we automatically enroll students and teachers into any courses offered through ENROLL. Enrollment will usually appear in Moodle 3-5 hours after official enrollments are done through ENROLL or entered by the Registrar. Self-enrollment If Self-enrollment is enabled then students can sign up for courses themselves. The teacher can restrict enrollment to those who have been given an Enrollment key and, if needed, a staff member may be given the Keyholder role to manage enrollment keys. Manual enrollment A teacher can view, activate, add and remove participants within their course: From the Navigation Drawer (3 horizontal lines on the top left corner if closed), select Participants Click the Enrol users button Search by email address, username, or full name and click their name Repeat this step if adding more than 1 user Use the 'Assign roles' drop-down if you wish to change the role See Moodle: Roles and Permissions for guidance Click the 'Enrol selected users and cohorts' button when finished General courses typically do not need manual enrollment as students officially registered into the course are automatically enrolled into the course page, and the teacher does not need to do anything. Sometimes teachers might need to add students who are not officially registered in the course through Registrar, or when they are operating a non-registered course (e.g., Non-Course Sites). Adding students in bulk When using Manual enrollment, the teacher may select and enroll several students at once. An administrator can enroll students in bulk into a course with a CSV file. Cohorts, that is, site or category-wide batches of users, may be added to courses using the Cohort sync enrollment method. Note that cohorts must first exist on the site. Contact Academic Technology if you need to enroll a large number of people into a course page. We will be happy to help you out! Allowing guests into a course Guests may be allowed to view course contents, but not participate in them, if Guest access is enabled. Guest access is not recommended because of how limited it is. To allow someone from Carleton into your course, it is recommended that you manually enroll them as a Student. To allow access to someone from outside of Carleton, see the next section on how non-Carleton people can log into our Moodle server. Adding non @carleton.edu participants In order to add people from different organizations, they must first create a Google account on our Moodle server. This is useful when teachers are collaborating with St. Olaf professors or other teachers at different institutions. For more information on how to do this click here . Linked courses The Course meta-link enrollment method allows users who are in another course to be automatically enrolled into your course as well. An example might be if a Moodle site has a course for ""Staff Only"" and a course for ""Moodle Help"". If the ""Staff Only"" course is added to the ""Moodle Help"" course with the course meta link plugin, then every time a new member of staff joins the ""Staff Only"" course, they will automatically be enrolled in the ""Moodle Help"" course too. We automatically create a joint course page any time the same professor teaches two sections of the same course and then we can auto-enroll the faculty as a teacher of that course page. Teachers then have to use the Course meta link enrollment method to link to their individual course sections. When doing this, the enrollments remain up to to date as students add or drop the course, and groups based on the linked course sections are also created and enrollments maintained. Teachers can only select from courses in which they are teachers when using this method. If you have more questions about enrollments in linked courses, you can submit a ticket or contact AT for help. Acknowledgement Created by Walt Li '23, Tue 10/26/21."
Moodle: Roles and Permissions,https://stolafcarleton.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2092/Carleton/KB/ArticleDet?ID=138792,"This article describes the several roles in Moodle and their permissions. Some roles are customized for and specific to Carleton. Table of Content Roles types Change roles of participants Checking permissions Switching temporarily to another role Permissions in a block Adding Participants Manually From the Navigation Drawer (3 horizontal lines on the top left corner if closed), Select Participants Click the Enrol users button Search by email address, username, or full name Click their name Repeat steps 3-4 if adding more than 1 person Use the ' Assign roles ' drop-down (use the list below to for guidance) Click the ' Enrol selected users ' button when finished Roles types Teacher Teachers can do almost anything within a course, including adding or changing the activities and grading students. By default, teachers can also assign a Non-editing teacher role and a Student role to other users. TA Teacher TA Teachers will be a teacher in the course, so they have the same capabilities. However, this role will NOT sync to meta-courses. Student TA Student TAs cannot create activities, but they can create and manage time slots within a Scheduler created by the teacher.  Student TAs can also post and reply to the Announcements forum or use the Attendance module to take attendance. Otherwise, Student TAs have the same privileges as students and CANNOT see the gradebook. Non-editing Teacher Non-editing teachers can teach in the course and grade students, but may not alter activities and resources. This role might typically be given to a classroom assistant for example. Course Editor Course Editors can make changes to the courses, but do not have access to the gradebook. Grader Graders have student privileges, but can also grade assignments, quizzes, LTI activities, and workshops. Graders CANNOT view the gradebook. Librarian Librarians can see all assignments that are available to students. They can also post to the Announcements forum, and add pages or blocks for sharing library information. Student A user with the Student role in Moodle can participate in course activities and view resources but not alter them or see the class gradebook. They can see their own grades if the teacher has allowed this. Change roles of participants You must have the role ""Teacher"" in the course to change the roles of participants. Click on the menu (the three-line icon) in the upper left of your course page. Choose Participants to view the participants For each participant, you may change their role under the Roles column by clicking the ✐ pencil icon. You may assign multiple roles to a participant Click the 💾 save icon to save changes on the participant Checking permissions The check permissions feature provides a method to view all roles both in the current context and higher contexts and capabilities for a selected user based on their role assignments. These capabilities determine whether or not the selected user is allowed to perform associated tasks within the system or course. To check the permissions: Enter the Course administration page. On Fordson ( Do not force) , this is via the buttons Course Management section (the icon in the top-left). On Moove and Carleton Boost, this is via the Actions menu (the icon in the top-right). To check or change permissions for roles in the course, go to Users > Permissions To check permissions for each user, go to Users > Permissions > Check permissions Switching temporarily to another role Sometimes it is convenient for a teacher to check whether a certain role has access to certain activities by temporarily switching their ""Teacher"" role to another role (for example, to ""Student""). To switch roles: On the course page, click on the avatar/account icon on the upper right corner Click Switch role to... and select the role to change to Permissions in a block To change role permissions for a block Turn editing on for your course. On Fordson ( Do not force) , this is the icon next to the icon in the top-left. On Moove and Carleton Boost, this is in the top right. In the actions menu in the header of the block, click Permissions . Now we can change the permission of the block (e.g., who can see the block) Acknowledgement Created by Walt Li '23, Tue 10/19/21."

Moodle: Options for Limiting Student Access,https://stolafcarleton.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2092/Carleton/KB/ArticleDet?ID=141617,"Once a Moodle course is made visible to students, it remains in that state until the faculty member chooses to change it. This can bring up issues for academic integrity, making it easy for students to access and share course materials well after they have participated in the course. To mitigate this situation, we offer the following options. Hide Course Once Complete After students no longer need access to your course page, you can toggle the visibility. On the top of your course page, click Settings. On the settings page, under general settings, on the right hand of Course Visibility, change from Show to Hide. Recommended : Warn students about one week before the end of the course so that they can retrieve materials they may want to keep. Use Access Restrictions You can set Access Restrictions on any portion of your course, either by individual activity or by course section. For this purpose, you can create a date-based restriction that will close access for students after a particular date. This is particularly useful when you want students to retain access to some course material, but want to keep online tests, assignments, or discussions restricted after the course is completed. Learn more about Access Restrictions here! Make Robust Assessments Rather than protecting assessments that are re-used from course to course, consider creating a question bank of assessment prompts in the Moodle Question Bank. The Question Bank can be organized and sorted so that it's easy to design Moodle quizzes that pull a random selection of questions from any number of categories in your question bank. Each time a student creates an attempt in Moodle Quiz, they will be given a new selection of questions. Some question types, such as the Calculated or Formula questions, also allow you to set an acceptable dataset for each value in your calculations. This allows you to create one question, but the values offered to each student will be different.  Because of the way these questions function, it will automatically correctly assess their response to the values they were offered. Learn more about how to use the Question Bank in Moodle here! Recommended : You can also use these options to encourage students to collaborate on questions without risking them copying answers. This is particularly powerful when used together with problem-based and team-based learning. Acknowledgement Created by Carly Born , Tue 2/22/22 1:20 PM"

Adobe Acrobat Pro: Properly Tagging Page Content & Setting Alternate Text for Figures,https://stolafcarleton.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2092/Carleton/KB/ArticleDet?ID=148037,"Accessibility management tools in Adobe Acrobat Pro allow for images, figures, and other objects such as text blocks to be selected in both a manual and automated manner. Appropriately marking page content types and correct reading order is important for making document content fully accessible to users of text-to-speech tools such as screen readers. Not doing so can make navigating the document using these tools incredibly cumbersome and may render content playback incomprehensible to users. Additionally, figures and images without alternative text for those utilizing text-to-speech tools are not considered accessible and heavily impact the overall accessibility of a document. Acrobat Pro allows users to insert alternate text for these figures and images as well. Documents that would most benefit from this process, of tagging content and entering alternate text for figures, include scanned documents, particularly photo scanned ones, documents with any images, or cosmetic irregularities, and documents with irregular read order. Table of Contents Marking Decorative/Cosmetic Objects Generally Marking Object Types and Reading Order Checking & Correcting Object Types and Reading Order Setting Alternate Text for Figures Marking Page Object Types & Reading Order To properly tag document objects and mark their reading order: Open the file in Acrobat Pro. OCR your file . Select the “Accessibility” shortcut in the features and tools navigation column, on the right hand side of your window. Expanded options will appear. If the shortcut is not present: Select the “More Tools” option at the bottom of the navigation column or the “Tools” tab on the navigation bar of your window. Under the Protect & Standardize section of tools, select the “Add” button below the “Accessibility” feature icon. The feature will now have a shortcut in the features and tools navigation column. Select the “Reading Order” option from the expanded tool options. A popup window will appear and page content tags will become visible to you. If the page tags and read order are clearly erroneous and/or disorganized , select the “Clear Page Structure…” button on the bottom of the popup window for each page of your file that this is the case. Cosmetic/Decorative Content Identify cosmetic page objects. If they cannot be removed using the Edit PDF feature, or you do not want to remove them, highlight them using your mouse - click and drag until the content is fully in the rectangular selection box. Your selection will then be highlighted in purple. Select the “Background/Artifact” option in your popup window. Do this for all the page objects/features you deem cosmetic. Cosmetic objects interfere with and hamper the playback of text-to-speech applications unless they are properly marked as such. Cosmetic objects can include headers, footers, page numbers, residual marks or page imperfections from scanning, page decorations, etc… If it is visible on the screen but does not impact understanding of the page content it is cosmetic. General Content Review the remaining page content, and in the order that the content is to be read highlight the remaining content in appropriate blocks, making sure everything you wanted to select is highlighted, and select the corresponding content type for each block. Content based/important images should be marked as “Figures” Checking & Correcting Content Type and Page Reading Order Toggle between the “Page content order” and “Structure types” options, in the “Show page content groups” selection in the lower half of the “Reading Order” popup window, to make sure everything on the page is appropriately marked and in the correct order. If the content groups are not in the appropriate reading order: Select the “Show Order Panel” button on the bottom of the popup window. The panel will appear on the left side of your window, in your tool specific navigation panel. Expand the selection of the document, and then the page, that you are currently working on. From there you can drag the content groups into the order that you would like them to be read. If the structure type of a content group needs to be corrected: Select, right-click, the indication of the structure type (its label). The content group indicator will turn blue. Left click the same content group and select the appropriate “Tag as [structure type]” option. Repeat steps 6-8 for every page in the file. It is recommended that you move between pages using the options available in the toolbar at the top of the window. Select the “Close” button in the “Reading Order” popup window when you have finished, or at any point to exit out of the feature. Inserting Alternate Text for Figures To set alternate text for figures throughout your file: Have the file open in Adobe Acrobat Pro. Properly tag object types across your file . Select the “Accessibility” shortcut in the features and tools navigation column on the right hand side of your window. If the shortcut is not present, follow the step 3 instructions above . Select the “Set Alternate Text” option from the expanded tool options, and in the following popup notification window, select “OK.” Toggle between the figures in your document and enter alternative text for each figure. If a figure is decorative (unimportant towards understanding the page or file content) mark it as such by selecting the “Decorative figure” option when prompted to enter alternate text for it. Select “Save & Close” when done or at any point to save your edits."
Adobe Acrobat Pro: Correcting Document Color Contrast Issues,https://stolafcarleton.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2092/Carleton/KB/ArticleDet?ID=148143,"One of the most common issues that hold back the accessibility of PDF documents is the insufficient color-contrast of text. Color contrast in documents need to be high enough so that people with color-blindness or difficulty seeing can still read the document. To fix this issue in Adobe Acrobat follow the steps below. Correcting Color Contrast Open your file in Adobe Acrobat Pro. Ensure that your file has been turned into editable text and images . Run an accessibility check on your document. Ensure that the text of your document is properly tagged and that the appropriate reading order has been set . Select “Acrobat Pro” in the menu bar of your display if you are using a Macintosh device, however, if you are using a Windows device select ""File;"" from there, on either operating system, select “Preferences” from the expanded options, and then the “Accessibility” category from the popup Window. Select the “Replace Document Colors” option and then the “Use High-Contrast colors” option. Choose the color combination you would like from the “High-contrast color combination” drop-down options (we recommend the “Black text on white” option). Make sure that the option to “Only change the color of black text or line art” is unchecked and that the option to “Change the color of line art as well as text” is checked. Select “OK” at the bottom right corner of the Preferences popup window. Acknowledgements Created by Mike Kombate '23, 12/6/2022"

Moodle: Quiz - Automatic and Manual Grading,https://stolafcarleton.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2092/Carleton/KB/ArticleDet?ID=141893&SIDs=11722,"Automatic vs Manual Grading Most quiz questions (multiple choice, true/false, etc.) can be automatically graded , meaning that Moodle will auto-calculate a score for the question. If a quiz has only automatically graded questions, then the total score for the quiz will be available as soon as the student completes their attempt. Manually graded questions, on the other hand, must be evaluated by a grader. For example, essay questions must always be manually graded. Moodle will not calculate the total score for a quiz if there are still questions that need to be manually graded. Enabling manual grading for an entire quiz To enable manual grading for your quiz including automatically graded questions: Click on your quiz on the main course page Click on the menu in the top right Click ""Edit settings"" Under Question behavior : How questions behave , select ""Manually graded"" Click either ""Save and return to course"" or ""Save and display"" at the bottom of the screen Manual grading methods Grading every student consecutively per question To grade responses for manually graded questions all at once: Click on your quiz on the main course page Click on the menu in the top right Select "" Manual grading"" Under Total , click ""grade all"" If you have already graded responses, you can also click ""update grades"" under Already graded to re-grade those responses. Student responses will be listed here. Add marks/comments to each question, then click ""Save and go to next page"" Check the ""Questions per page"" value: if the value is less than the total number of responses, the next page will contain more responses for the same question. For example, if the ""Questions per page"" value is 5 and there are 10 responses, the next page will contain the remaining 5 responses. Once you have finished marking/commenting, scroll to the top of the page and click the ""Back to list of questions"" link Grading individual attempts and question responses If you want to individually grade specific student attempts/responses: Click on your quiz on the main course page Click on the ""Attempts"" link in the middle of the page To review/grade a student's entire attempt: Under First name / Surname , click ""Review attempt"" beneath the student's name You will see the student's responses to each question.
