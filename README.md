# Carleton-Chat-AI-Llama
Repository for the updated Carleton AI chat program

Previously, a private AI was made using ChatGpt3.5, which turned out to be very costly. So, we are working on replacing the GPT-3.5 chatbot with Open source LLaMA model. We plan to use Streamlit and Replicate for that. We will integrate  pgpt python SDK for managing PrivateGPT APIs inorder to enhance  the model accuracy and performance.


This github repository is a refrence on the integration of the pgpt python SDK for managing privateGPT APIs.
